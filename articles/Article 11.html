(4) Performs an obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene exhibition of his or her body for gain; or
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(5) Creates, buys, procures or possesses obscene matter or material with intent to disseminate it in violation of this Section, or of the penal laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction; or
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(6) Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(b) Obscene Defined.
</p>
<p>
Any material or performance is obscene if: (1) the average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient interest; and (2) the average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd exhibition of the genitals; and (3) taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(c) Interpretation of Evidence.
</p>
<p>
Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults, except that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to such an audience.
</p>
<p>
Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
</p>
<p>
In any prosecution for an offense under this Section evidence shall be admissible to show:
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(1) The character of the audience for which the material was designed or to which it was directed;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) What the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have on the behavior of such people;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(3) The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of the material, or absence thereof;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(4) The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this State;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(5) Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising or other promotion of the material;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(6) Purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(d) Sentence.
</p>
<p>
Obscenity is a Class A misdemeanor. A second or subsequent offense is a Class 4 felony.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(e) Permissive Inference.
</p>
<p>
The trier of fact may infer an intent to disseminate from the creation, purchase, procurement or possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than 3 copies of obscene material.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(f) Affirmative Defenses.
</p>
<p>
It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity that the dissemination:
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(1) Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than children under 18 years of age;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other special justification for possession of such material.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(g) Forfeiture of property. A person who has been convicted previously of the offense of obscenity and who is convicted of a second or subsequent offense of obscenity is subject to the property forfeiture provisions set forth in Article 124B of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.

(b)(1) It shall be an affirmative defense to a charge of child pornography that the defendant reasonably believed, under all of the circumstances, that the child was 18 years of age or older or that the person was not a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability but only where, prior to the act or acts giving rise to a prosecution under this Section, he or she took some affirmative action or made a bonafide inquiry designed to ascertain whether the child was 18 years of age or older or that the person was not a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability and his or her reliance upon the information so obtained was clearly reasonable.

(g) Re-enactment; findings; purposes.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(1) The General Assembly finds and declares that:
</p>
<p class="item">
(i) Section 50-5 of Public Act 88-680, effective
</p>
<p>
January 1, 1995, contained provisions amending the child pornography statute, Section 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961. Section 50-5 also contained other provisions.
</p>
<p class="item">
(ii) In addition, Public Act 88-680 was entitled
</p>
<p>
“AN ACT to create a Safe Neighborhoods Law”. (A) Article 5 was entitled JUVENILE JUSTICE and amended the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. (B) Article 15 was entitled GANGS and amended various provisions of the Criminal Code of 1961 and the Unified Code of Corrections. (C) Article 20 was entitled ALCOHOL ABUSE and amended various provisions of the Illinois Vehicle Code. (D) Article 25 was entitled DRUG ABUSE and amended the Cannabis Control Act and the Illinois Controlled Substances Act. (E) Article 30 was entitled FIREARMS and amended the Criminal Code of 1961 and the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. (F) Article 35 amended the Criminal Code of 1961, the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and the Unified Code of Corrections. (G) Article 40 amended the Criminal Code of 1961 to increase the penalty for compelling organization membership of persons. (H) Article 45 created the Secure Residential Youth Care Facility Licensing Act and amended the State Finance Act, the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Unified Code of Corrections, and the Private Correctional Facility Moratorium Act. (I) Article 50 amended the WIC Vendor Management Act, the Firearm Owners Identification Card Act, the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Criminal Code of 1961, the Wrongs to Children Act, and the Unified Code of Corrections.
</p>
<p class="item">
(iii) On September 22, 1998, the Third District
</p>
<p>
Appellate Court in People v. Dainty, 701 N.E. 2d 118, ruled that Public Act 88-680 violates the single subject clause of the Illinois Constitution (Article IV, Section 8 (d)) and was unconstitutional in its entirety. As of the time this amendatory Act of 1999 was prepared, People v. Dainty was still subject to appeal.
</p>
<p class="item">
(iv) Child pornography is a vital concern to the people of this State and the validity of future prosecutions under the child pornography statute of the Criminal Code of 1961 is in grave doubt.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) It is the purpose of this amendatory Act of 1999 to prevent or minimize any problems relating to prosecutions for child pornography that may result from challenges to the constitutional validity of Public Act 88-680 by re-enacting the Section relating to child pornography that was included in Public Act 88-680.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(3) This amendatory Act of 1999 re-enacts Section
</p>
<p>
11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961, as it has been amended. This re-enactment is intended to remove any question as to the validity or content of that Section; it is not intended to supersede any other Public Act that amends the text of the Section as set forth in this amendatory Act of 1999. The material is shown as existing text (i.e., without underscoring) because, as of the time this amendatory Act of 1999 was prepared, People v. Dainty was subject to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(4) The re-enactment by this amendatory Act of 1999 of Section 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961 relating to child pornography that was amended by Public Act 88-680 is not intended, and shall not be construed, to imply that Public Act 88-680 is invalid or to limit or impair any legal argument concerning whether those provisions were substantially re-enacted by other Public Acts.
