<p class="subsection">
(a) Within 14 days of the seizure, the State’s Attorney of the county in which the seizure occurred shall seek a preliminary determination from the circuit court as to whether there is probable cause that the property may be subject to forfeiture.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(b) The rules of evidence shall not apply to any proceeding conducted under this Section.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(c) The court may conduct the review under subsection (a) of this Section simultaneously with a proceeding under Section 109-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 for a related criminal offense if a prosecution is commenced by information or complaint.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(d) The court may accept a finding of probable cause at a preliminary hearing following the filing of an information or complaint charging a related criminal offense or following the return of indictment by a grand jury charging the related offense as sufficient evidence of probable cause as required under subsection (a) of this Section.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(e) Upon making a finding of probable cause as required under this Section, the circuit court shall order the property subject to the provisions of the applicable forfeiture Act held until the conclusion of any forfeiture proceeding.
</p>
<p>
For seizures of conveyances, within 28 days of a finding of probable cause under subsection (a) of this Section, the registered owner or other claimant may file a motion in writing supported by sworn affidavits claiming that denial of the use of the conveyance during the pendency of the forfeiture proceedings creates a substantial hardship and alleges facts showing that the hardship was not due to his or her culpable negligence. The court shall consider the following factors in determining whether a substantial hardship has been proven:
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(1) the nature of the claimed hardship;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) the availability of public transportation or other available means of transportation; and
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(3) any available alternatives to alleviate the hardship other than the return of the seized conveyance.
</p>
<p>
If the court determines that a substantial hardship has been proven, the court shall then balance the nature of the hardship against the State’s interest in safeguarding the conveyance. If the court determines that the hardship outweighs the State’s interest in safeguarding the conveyance, the court may temporarily release the conveyance to the registered owner or the registered owner’s authorized designee, or both, until the conclusion of the forfeiture proceedings or for such shorter period as ordered by the court provided that the person to whom the conveyance is released provides proof of insurance and a valid driver’s license and all State and local registrations for operation of the conveyance are current. The court shall place conditions on the conveyance limiting its use to the stated hardship and providing transportation for employment, religious purposes, medical needs, child care, and restricting the conveyance’s use to only those individuals authorized to use the conveyance by the registered owner. The use of the vehicle shall be further restricted to exclude all recreational and entertainment purposes. The court may order additional restrictions it deems reasonable and just on its own motion or on motion of the People. The court shall revoke the order releasing the conveyance and order that the conveyance be reseized by law enforcement if the conditions of release are violated or if the conveyance is used in the commission of any offense identified in subsection (a) of Section 6-205 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.
</p>
<p>
If the court orders the release of the conveyance during the pendency of the forfeiture proceedings, the court may order the registered owner or his or her authorized designee to post a cash security with the clerk of the court as ordered by the court. If cash security is ordered, the court shall consider the following factors in determining the amount of the cash security:
</p>
<p class="subparagraph">
(A) the full market value of the conveyance;
</p>
<p class="subparagraph">
(B) the nature of the hardship;
</p>
<p class="subparagraph">
(C) the extent and length of the usage of the conveyance;
</p>
<p class="subparagraph">
(D) the ability of the owner or designee to pay; and
</p>
<p class="subparagraph">
(E) other conditions as the court deems necessary to safeguard the conveyance.
</p>
<p>
If the conveyance is released, the court shall order that the registered owner or his or her designee safeguard the conveyance, not remove the conveyance from the jurisdiction, not conceal, destroy, or otherwise dispose of the conveyance, not encumber the conveyance, and not diminish the value of the conveyance in any way. The court shall also make a determination of the full market value of the conveyance prior to it being released based on a source or sources defined in 50 Ill. Adm. Code 919.80(c)(2)(A) or 919.80(c)(2)(B).
</p>
<p>
If the conveyance subject to forfeiture is released under this Section and is subsequently forfeited, the person to whom the conveyance was released shall return the conveyance to the law enforcement agency that seized the conveyance within 7 days from the date of the declaration of forfeiture or order of forfeiture. If the conveyance is not returned within 7 days, the cash security shall be forfeited in the same manner as the conveyance subject to forfeiture. If the cash security was less than the full market value, a judgment shall be entered against the parties to whom the conveyance was released and the registered owner, jointly and severally, for the difference between the full market value and the amount of the cash security. If the conveyance is returned in a condition other than the condition in which it was released, the cash security shall be returned to the surety who posted the security minus the amount of the diminished value, and that amount shall be forfeited in the same manner as the conveyance subject to forfeiture. Additionally, the court may enter an order allowing any law enforcement agency in the State of Illinois to seize the conveyance wherever it may be found in the State to satisfy the judgment if the cash security was less than the full market value of the conveyance.

<p class="subsection">
(a) If the State’s Attorney of the county in which such seizure occurs finds that the alleged violation of law giving rise to the seizure was incurred without willful negligence or without any intention on the part of the owner of the vessel or watercraft, vehicle, or aircraft or any person whose right, title, or interest is of record as described in Section 36-1 of this Article, to violate the law, or finds the existence of such mitigating circumstances as to justify remission of the forfeiture, he or she may cause the law enforcement agency having custody of the property to return the property to the owner within a reasonable time not to exceed 7 days. The State’s Attorney shall exercise his or her discretion under this subsection (a) prior to or promptly after the preliminary review under Section 36-1.5.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(b) If, after review of the facts surrounding the seizure, the State’s Attorney is of the opinion that the seized property is subject to forfeiture and the State’s Attorney does not cause the forfeiture to be remitted under subsection (a) of this Section, he or she shall bring an action for forfeiture in the circuit court within whose jurisdiction the seizure and confiscation has taken place by filing a verified complaint for forfeiture in the circuit court within whose jurisdiction the seizure occurred, or within whose jurisdiction an act or omission giving rise to the seizure occurred, subject to Supreme Court Rule 187. The complaint shall be filed as soon as practicable but not later than 28 days after the State’s Attorney receives notice from the seizing agency as provided under Section 36-1.4 of this Article. A complaint of forfeiture shall include:
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(1) a description of the property seized;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) the date and place of seizure of the property;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(3) the name and address of the law enforcement agency making the seizure; and
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(4) the specific statutory and factual grounds for the seizure.
</p>
<p>
The complaint shall be served upon each person whose right, title, or interest is of record in the office of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency, or any other department of this State, or any other state of the United States if the vessel or watercraft, vehicle, or aircraft is required to be so registered, as the case may be, the person from whom the property was seized, and all persons known or reasonably believed by the State to claim an interest in the property, as provided in this Article. The complaint shall be accompanied by the following written notice:
</p>
<p>
“This is a civil court proceeding subject to the Code of Civil Procedure. You received this Complaint of Forfeiture because the State’s Attorney’s office has brought a legal action seeking forfeiture of your seized property. This complaint starts the court process where the State seeks to prove that your property should be forfeited and not returned to you. This process is also your opportunity to try to prove to a judge that you should get your property back. The complaint lists the date, time, and location of your first court date. You must appear in court on that day, or you may lose the case automatically. You must also file an appearance and answer. If you are unable to pay the appearance fee, you may qualify to have the fee waived. If there is a criminal case related to the seizure of your property, your case may be set for trial after the criminal case has been resolved. Before trial, the judge may allow discovery, where the State can ask you to respond in writing to questions and give them certain documents, and you can make similar requests of the State. The trial is your opportunity to explain what happened when your property was seized and why you should get the property back.”

(ii) If no signed return receipt is received by the State’s Attorney within 28 days of the second attempt at service by certified mail, and no communication from the owner or interest holder is received by the State’s Attorney documenting actual notice by said parties, the State’s Attorney shall have 60 days to attempt to serve the notice by personal service, which also includes substitute service by leaving a copy at the usual place of abode with some person of the family or a person residing there, of the age of 13 years or upwards. If, after 3 attempts at service in this manner, no service of the notice is accomplished, then the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous manner at this address and service shall be made by the posting.
</p>
<p>
The attempts at service and the posting, if required, shall be documented by the person attempting service and said documentation shall be made part of a return of service returned to the State’s Attorney.

<p>
For purposes of notice under this Section, if a person has been arrested for the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, the address provided to the arresting agency at the time of arrest shall be deemed to be that person’s known address. Provided, however, if an owner or interest holder’s address changes prior to the effective date of the complaint for forfeiture, the owner or interest holder shall promptly notify the seizing agency of the change in address or, if the owner or interest holder’s address changes subsequent to the effective date of the notice of pending forfeiture, the owner or interest holder shall promptly notify the State’s Attorney of the change in address; or if the property seized is a conveyance, to the address reflected in the office of the agency or official in which title to or interest in the conveyance is required by law to be recorded.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) If the owner’s or interest holder’s address is not known, and is not on record, then notice shall be served by publication for 3 successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the seizure occurred.

Whenever any owner of, or other person interested in, a vessel or watercraft, vehicle, or aircraft seized under the provisions of this Act files with the Attorney General before the sale or destruction of such vessel or watercraft, vehicle, or aircraft, a petition for the remission of such forfeiture the Attorney General if he finds that such forfeiture was incurred without willful negligence or without any intention on the part of the owner or any person whose right, title or interest is of record as described in Section 36-1, to violate the law, or finds the existence of such mitigating circumstances as to justify the remission of forfeiture, may cause the same to be remitted upon such terms and conditions as he deems reasonable and just, or order discontinuance of any forfeiture proceeding relating thereto.
