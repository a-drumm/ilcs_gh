Except as otherwise provided, for all felonies:
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(a) NO SUPERVISION. The court, upon a plea of guilty or a stipulation by the defendant of the facts supporting the charge or a finding of guilt, may not defer further proceedings and the imposition of a sentence and may not enter an order for supervision of the defendant.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(b) FELONY FINES. Unless otherwise specified by law, the minimum fine is $75. An offender may be sentenced to pay a fine not to exceed, for each offense, $25,000 or the amount specified in the offense, whichever is greater, or if the offender is a corporation, $50,000 or the amount specified in the offense, whichever is greater. A fine may be imposed in addition to a sentence of conditional discharge, probation, periodic imprisonment, or imprisonment. See Article 9 of Chapter V (730 ILCS 5/Ch. V, Art. 9) for imposition of additional amounts and determination of amounts and payment. If the court finds that the fine would impose an undue burden on the victim, the court may reduce or waive the fine.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(c) REASONS FOR SENTENCE STATED. The sentencing judge in each felony conviction shall set forth his or her reasons for imposing the particular sentence entered in the case, as provided in Section 5-4-1 (730 ILCS 5/5-4-1). Those reasons may include any mitigating or aggravating factors specified in this Code, or the lack of any such factors, as well as any other mitigating or aggravating factors that the judge sets forth on the record that are consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing set out in this Code.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(d) MOTION TO REDUCE SENTENCE. A motion to reduce a sentence may be made, or the court may reduce a sentence without motion, within 30 days after the sentence is imposed. A defendant’s challenge to the correctness of a sentence or to any aspect of the sentencing hearing shall be made by a written motion filed with the circuit court clerk within 30 days following the imposition of sentence. A motion not filed within that 30-day period is not timely. The court may not increase a sentence once it is imposed. A notice of motion must be filed with the motion. The notice of motion shall set the motion on the court’s calendar on a date certain within a reasonable time after the date of filing.
</p>
<p>
If a motion filed pursuant to this subsection is timely filed, the proponent of the motion shall exercise due diligence in seeking a determination on the motion and the court shall thereafter decide the motion within a reasonable time.
</p>
<p>
If a motion filed pursuant to this subsection is timely filed, then for purposes of perfecting an appeal, a final judgment is not considered to have been entered until the motion to reduce the sentence has been decided by order entered by the trial court.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(e) CONCURRENT SENTENCE; PREVIOUS UNEXPIRED FEDERAL OR OTHER-STATE SENTENCE. A defendant who has a previous and unexpired sentence of imprisonment imposed by another state or by any district court of the United States and who, after sentence for a crime in Illinois, must return to serve the unexpired prior sentence may have his or her sentence by the Illinois court ordered to be concurrent with the prior other-state or federal sentence. The court may order that any time served on the unexpired portion of the other-state or federal sentence, prior to his or her return to Illinois, shall be credited on his or her Illinois sentence. The appropriate official of the other state or the United States shall be furnished with a copy of the order imposing sentence, which shall provide that, when the offender is released from other-state or federal confinement, whether by parole or by termination of sentence, the offender shall be transferred by the Sheriff of the committing Illinois county to the Illinois Department of Corrections. The court shall cause the Department of Corrections to be notified of the sentence at the time of commitment and to be provided with copies of all records regarding the sentence.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(f) REDUCTION; PREVIOUS UNEXPIRED ILLINOIS SENTENCE. A defendant who has a previous and unexpired sentence of imprisonment imposed by an Illinois circuit court for a crime in this State and who is subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment by another state or by any district court of the United States and who has served a term of imprisonment imposed by the other state or district court of the United States, and must return to serve the unexpired prior sentence imposed by the Illinois circuit court, may apply to the Illinois circuit court that imposed sentence to have his or her sentence reduced.
</p>
<p>
The circuit court may order that any time served on the sentence imposed by the other state or district court of the United States be credited on his or her Illinois sentence. The application for reduction of a sentence under this subsection shall be made within 30 days after the defendant has completed the sentence imposed by the other state or district court of the United States.

(1) At the sentencing hearing conducted under Section 5-4-1 of this Code, the court may depart from the sentencing guidelines provided in subsection (c) of this Section and impose a sentence otherwise authorized by law for the offense if the court, after considering any factor under paragraph (2) of this subsection (d) relevant to the nature and circumstances of the crime and to the history and character of the defendant, finds on the record substantial and compelling justification that the sentence within the sentencing guidelines would be unduly harsh and that a sentence otherwise authorized by law would be consistent with public safety and does not deprecate the seriousness of the offense.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) In deciding whether to depart from the sentencing guidelines under this paragraph, the court shall consider:
</p>
<p class="subparagraph">
(A) the age, immaturity, or limited mental capacity of the defendant at the time of commission of the qualifying predicate or current offense, including whether the defendant was suffering from a mental or physical condition insufficient to constitute a defense but significantly reduced the defendant’s culpability;

</p>
<p class="subparagraph">
(G) whether the defendant aided in the apprehension of another felon or testified truthfully on behalf of another prosecution of a felony; and
</p>
<p class="subparagraph">
(H) whether departure is in the interest of the person’s rehabilitation, including employment or educational or vocational training, after taking into account any past rehabilitation efforts or dispositions of probation or supervision, and the defendant’s cooperation or response to rehabilitation.

<p class="paragraph">
(3) When departing from the sentencing guidelines under this Section, the court shall specify on the record, the particular evidence, information, factor or factors, or other reasons which led to the departure from the sentencing guidelines. When departing from the sentencing range in accordance with this subsection (d), the court shall indicate on the sentencing order which departure factor or factors outlined in paragraph (2) of this subsection (d) led to the sentence imposed. The sentencing order shall be filed with the clerk of the court and shall be a public record.

In accordance with Section 4.5(d)(4) of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act and Section 10 of the Open Parole Hearings Act, victim statements provided to the Board shall be confidential and privileged, including any statements received prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly, except if the statement was an oral statement made by the victim at a hearing open to the public. Victim statements shall not be considered public documents under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. The inmate or his or her attorney shall not be given a copy of the statement, but shall be informed of the existence of a victim statement and the position taken by the victim on the inmate’s request for parole. This shall not be construed to permit disclosure to an inmate of any information which might result in the risk of threats or physical harm to a victim. The Prisoner Review Board shall have an ongoing duty to provide the eligible person, and his or her counsel, with any further documents or materials that come into its possession prior to the hearing subject to the limitations contained in this subsection.
