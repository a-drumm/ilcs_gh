<p>
The General Assembly finds that in order to protect the public, the criminal justice system must compel compliance with the conditions of probation by responding to violations with swift, certain and fair punishments and intermediate sanctions. The Chief Judge of each circuit shall adopt a system of structured, intermediate sanctions for violations of the terms and conditions of a sentence of probation, conditional discharge or disposition of supervision.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(a) Except where specifically prohibited by other provisions of this Code, the court shall impose a sentence of probation or conditional discharge upon an offender unless, having regard to the nature and circumstance of the offense, and to the history, character and condition of the offender, the court is of the opinion that:
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(1) his imprisonment or periodic imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the public; or
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) probation or conditional discharge would deprecate the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and would be inconsistent with the ends of justice; or
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(3) a combination of imprisonment with concurrent or consecutive probation when an offender has been admitted into a drug court program under Section 20 of the Drug Court Treatment Act is necessary for the protection of the public and for the rehabilitation of the offender.
</p>
<p>
The court shall impose as a condition of a sentence of probation, conditional discharge, or supervision, that the probation agency may invoke any sanction from the list of intermediate sanctions adopted by the chief judge of the circuit court for violations of the terms and conditions of the sentence of probation, conditional discharge, or supervision, subject to the provisions of Section 5-6-4 of this Act.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(b) The court may impose a sentence of conditional discharge for an offense if the court is of the opinion that neither a sentence of imprisonment nor of periodic imprisonment nor of probation supervision is appropriate.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(b-1) Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section do not apply to a defendant charged with a misdemeanor or felony under the Illinois Vehicle Code or reckless homicide under Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 if the defendant within the past 12 months has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor or felony under the Illinois Vehicle Code or reckless homicide under Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(c) The court may, upon a plea of guilty or a stipulation by the defendant of the facts supporting the charge or a finding of guilt, defer further proceedings and the imposition of a sentence, and enter an order for supervision of the defendant, if the defendant is not charged with: (i) a Class A misdemeanor, as defined by the following provisions of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012: Sections 11-9.1; 12-3.2; 11-1.50 or 12-15; 26-5 or 48-1; 31-1; 31-6; 31-7; paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (a) of Section 21-1; paragraph (1) through (5), (8), (10), and (11) of subsection (a) of Section 24-1; (ii) a Class A misdemeanor violation of Section 3.01, 3.03-1, or 4.01 of the Humane Care for Animals Act; or (iii) a felony. If the defendant is not barred from receiving an order for supervision as provided in this subsection, the court may enter an order for supervision after considering the circumstances of the offense, and the history, character and condition of the offender, if the court is of the opinion that:
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(1) the offender is not likely to commit further crimes;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) the defendant and the public would be best served if the defendant were not to receive a criminal record; and
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(3) in the best interests of justice an order of supervision is more appropriate than a sentence otherwise permitted under this Code.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(c-5) Subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this Section do not apply to a defendant charged with a second or subsequent violation of Section 6-303 of the Illinois Vehicle Code committed while his or her driver’s license, permit or privileges were revoked because of a violation of Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, relating to the offense of reckless homicide, or a similar provision of a law of another state.

<p class="subsection">
(a) When an offender is sentenced to probation or conditional discharge, the court shall impose a period as provided in Article 4.5 of Chapter V, and shall specify the conditions under Section 5-6-3.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(b) Multiple terms of probation imposed at the same time shall run concurrently.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(c) The court may at any time terminate probation or conditional discharge if warranted by the conduct of the offender and the ends of justice, as provided in Section 5-6-4.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(c-1) For purposes of this subsection (c-1), a “violent offense” means an offense in which bodily harm is inflicted or force is used against any person or threatened against any person; an offense involving sexual conduct, sexual penetration, or sexual exploitation; an offense involving domestic violence; an offense of domestic battery, violation of an order of protection, stalking, or hate crime; an offense of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol; or an offense involving the possession of a firearm or dangerous weapon. An offender, other than an offender sentenced on a violent offense, shall be entitled to a time credit toward the completion of the offender’s probation or conditional discharge as follows:
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(1) For obtaining a high school diploma or GED: 90 days.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) For obtaining an associate’s degree, career certificate, or vocational technical certification: 120 days.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(3) For obtaining a bachelor’s degree: 180 days.
</p>
<p>
An offender’s supervising officer shall promptly and as soon as practicable notify the court of the offender’s right to time credits under this subsection (c-1). Upon receipt of this notification, the court shall enter an order modifying the offender’s remaining period of probation or conditional discharge to reflect the time credit earned. If, before the expiration of the original period or a reduced period of probation or conditional discharge, the court, after a hearing under Section 5-6-4 of this Code, finds that an offender violated one or more conditions of probation or conditional discharge, the court may order that some or all of the time credit to which the offender is entitled under this Section be forfeited.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(d) Upon the expiration or termination of the period of probation or of conditional discharge, the court shall enter an order discharging the offender.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(e) The court may extend any period of probation or conditional discharge beyond the limits set forth in Article 4.5 of Chapter V upon a violation of a condition of the probation or conditional discharge, for the payment of an assessment required by Section 10.3 of the Cannabis Control Act, Section 411.2 of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, or Section 80 of the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, or for the payment of restitution as provided by an order of restitution under Section 5-5-6 of this Code.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(e-5) If payment of restitution as ordered has not been made, the victim shall file a petition notifying the sentencing court, any other person to whom restitution is owed, and the State’s Attorney of the status of the ordered restitution payments unpaid at least 90 days before the probation or conditional discharge expiration date. If payment as ordered has not been made, the court shall hold a review hearing prior to the expiration date, unless the hearing is voluntarily waived by the defendant with the knowledge that waiver may result in an extension of the probation or conditional discharge period or in a revocation of probation or conditional discharge. If the court does not extend probation or conditional discharge, it shall issue a judgment for the unpaid restitution and direct the clerk of the circuit court to file and enter the judgment in the judgment and lien docket, without fee, unless it finds that the victim has recovered a judgment against the defendant for the amount covered by the restitution order. If the court issues a judgment for the unpaid restitution, the court shall send to the defendant at his or her last known address written notification that a civil judgment has been issued for the unpaid restitution.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(f) The court may impose a term of probation that is concurrent or consecutive to a term of imprisonment so long as the maximum term imposed does not exceed the maximum term provided under Article 4.5 of Chapter V or Article 8 of this Chapter. The court may provide that probation may commence while an offender is on mandatory supervised release, participating in a day release program, or being monitored by an electronic monitoring device.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(g) The court may extend a term of probation or conditional discharge that was concurrent to, consecutive to, or otherwise interrupted by a term of imprisonment for the purpose of providing additional time to complete an order of restitution.

The community service shall include, but not be limited to, the cleanup and repair of any damage caused by a violation of Section 21-1.3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 and similar damage to property located within the municipality or county in which the violation occurred. When possible and reasonable, the community service should be performed in the offender’s neighborhood.

The court shall revoke the probation or conditional discharge of a person who willfully fails to comply with this paragraph (7). The person on probation or conditional discharge shall be required to pay for the cost of the educational courses or high school equivalency testing if a fee is charged for those courses or testing. The court shall resentence the offender whose probation or conditional discharge has been revoked as provided in Section 5-6-4.

(i) The court shall impose upon a defendant placed on supervision after January 1, 1992 or to community service under the supervision of a probation or court services department after January 1, 2004, as a condition of supervision or supervised community service, a fee of $50 for each month of supervision or supervised community service ordered by the court, unless after determining the inability of the person placed on supervision or supervised community service to pay the fee, the court assesses a lesser fee. The court may not impose the fee on a minor who is placed in the guardianship or custody of the Department of Children and Family Services under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 while the minor is in placement. The fee shall be imposed only upon a defendant who is actively supervised by the probation and court services department. The fee shall be collected by the clerk of the circuit court. The clerk of the circuit court shall pay all monies collected from this fee to the county treasurer for deposit in the probation and court services fund pursuant to Section 15.1 of the Probation and Probation Officers Act.

<p>
A circuit court may not impose a probation fee in excess of $25 per month unless the circuit court has adopted, by administrative order issued by the chief judge, a standard probation fee guide determining an offender’s ability to pay. Of the amount collected as a probation fee, not to exceed $5 of that fee collected per month may be used to provide services to crime victims and their families.
</p>
<p>
The Court may only waive probation fees based on an offender’s ability to pay. The probation department may re-evaluate an offender’s ability to pay every 6 months, and, with the approval of the Director of Court Services or the Chief Probation Officer, adjust the monthly fee amount. An offender may elect to pay probation fees due in a lump sum. Any offender that has been assigned to the supervision of a probation department, or has been transferred either under subsection (h) of this Section or under any interstate compact, shall be required to pay probation fees to the department supervising the offender, based on the offender’s ability to pay.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec.-5-6-3.6.-first-time-weapon-offender-program.">Sec. 5-6-3.6. First Time Weapon Offender Program.</h2>
<p class="subsection">
(a) The General Assembly has sought to promote public safety, reduce recidivism, and conserve valuable resources of the criminal justice system through the creation of diversion programs for non-violent offenders. This amendatory Act of the 100th General Assembly establishes a pilot program for first-time, non-violent offenders charged with certain weapons offenses. The General Assembly recognizes some persons, particularly young adults in areas of high crime or poverty, may have experienced trauma that contributes to poor decision making skills, and the creation of a diversionary program poses a greater benefit to the community and the person than incarceration. Under this program, a court, with the consent of the defendant and the State’s Attorney, may sentence a defendant charged with an unlawful use of weapons offense under Section 24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012 or aggravated unlawful use of a weapon offense under Section 24-1.6 of the Criminal Code of 2012, if punishable as a Class 4 felony or lower, to a First Time Weapon Offender Program.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(b) A defendant is not eligible for this Program if:
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(1) the offense was committed during the commission of a violent offense as defined in subsection (h) of this Section;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) he or she has previously been convicted or placed on probation or conditional discharge for any violent offense under the laws of this State, the laws of any other state, or the laws of the United States;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(3) he or she had a prior successful completion of the First Time Weapon Offender Program under this Section;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(4) he or she has previously been adjudicated a delinquent minor for the commission of a violent offense;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(5) he or she is 21 years of age or older; or
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(6) he or she has an existing order of protection issued against him or her.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(b-5) In considering whether a defendant shall be sentenced to the First Time Weapon Offender Program, the court shall consider the following:
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(1) the age, immaturity, or limited mental capacity of the defendant;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) the nature and circumstances of the offense;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(3) whether participation in the Program is in the interest of the defendant’s rehabilitation, including any employment or involvement in community, educational, training, or vocational programs;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(4) whether the defendant suffers from trauma, as supported by documentation or evaluation by a licensed professional; and
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(5) the potential risk to public safety.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(c) For an offense committed on or after January 1, 2018 (the effective date of Public Act 100-3) and before January 1, 2024, whenever an eligible person pleads guilty to an unlawful use of weapons offense under Section 24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012 or aggravated unlawful use of a weapon offense under Section 24-1.6 of the Criminal Code of 2012, which is punishable as a Class 4 felony or lower, the court, with the consent of the defendant and the State’s Attorney, may, without entering a judgment, sentence the defendant to complete the First Time Weapon Offender Program. When a defendant is placed in the Program, the court shall defer further proceedings in the case until the conclusion of the period or until the filing of a petition alleging violation of a term or condition of the Program. Upon violation of a term or condition of the Program, the court may enter a judgment on its original finding of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided by law. Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions of the Program, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(d) The Program shall be at least 18 months and not to exceed 24 months, as determined by the court at the recommendation of the Program administrator and the State’s Attorney. The Program administrator may be appointed by the Chief Judge of each Judicial Circuit.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(e) The conditions of the Program shall be that the defendant:
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(1) not violate any criminal statute of this State or any other jurisdiction;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) refrain from possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(3) obtain or attempt to obtain employment;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(4) attend educational courses designed to prepare the defendant for obtaining a high school diploma or to work toward passing high school equivalency testing or to work toward completing a vocational training program;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(5) refrain from having in his or her body the presence of any illicit drug prohibited by the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, the Cannabis Control Act, or the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, unless prescribed by a physician, and submit samples of his or her blood or urine or both for tests to determine the presence of any illicit drug;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(6) perform a minimum of 50 hours of community service;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(7) attend and participate in any Program activities deemed required by the Program administrator, including but not limited to: counseling sessions, in-person and over the phone check-ins, and educational classes; and
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(8) pay all fines, assessments, fees, and costs.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(f) The Program may, in addition to other conditions, require that the defendant:
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(1) wear an ankle bracelet with GPS tracking;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) undergo medical or psychiatric treatment, or treatment or rehabilitation approved by the Department of Human Services; and
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(3) attend or reside in a facility established for the instruction or residence of defendants on probation.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(g) There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this Section. If a person is convicted of any offense which occurred within 5 years subsequent to a discharge and dismissal under this Section, the discharge and dismissal under this Section shall be admissible in the sentencing proceeding for that conviction as evidence in aggravation.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(h) For purposes of this Section, “violent offense” means any offense in which bodily harm was inflicted or force was used against any person or threatened against any person; any offense involving the possession of a firearm or dangerous weapon; any offense involving sexual conduct, sexual penetration, or sexual exploitation; violation of an order of protection, stalking, hate crime, domestic battery, or any offense of domestic violence.

<p class="subsection">
(a) Except in cases where conditional discharge or supervision was imposed for a petty offense as defined in Section 5-1-17, when a petition is filed charging a violation of a condition, the court may:

(1) in the case of probation violations, order the issuance of a notice to the offender to be present by the County Probation Department or such other agency designated by the court to handle probation matters; and in the case of conditional discharge or supervision violations, such notice to the offender shall be issued by the Circuit Court Clerk; and in the case of a violation of a sentence of county impact incarceration, such notice shall be issued by the Sheriff;
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
(2) order a summons to the offender to be present for hearing; or

Personal service of the petition for violation of probation or the issuance of such warrant, summons or notice shall toll the period of probation, conditional discharge, supervision, or sentence of county impact incarceration until the final determination of the charge, and the term of probation, conditional discharge, supervision, or sentence of county impact incarceration shall not run until the hearing and disposition of the petition for violation.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(b) The court shall conduct a hearing of the alleged violation. The court shall admit the offender to pretrial release pending the hearing unless the alleged violation is itself a criminal offense in which case the offender shall be admitted to pretrial release on such terms as are provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, as amended. In any case where an offender remains incarcerated only as a result of his alleged violation of the court’s earlier order of probation, supervision, conditional discharge, or county impact incarceration such hearing shall be held within 14 days of the onset of said incarceration, unless the alleged violation is the commission of another offense by the offender during the period of probation, supervision or conditional discharge in which case such hearing shall be held within the time limits described in Section 103-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, as amended.
</p>
<p class="subsection">

</p>
<p class="subsection">
(d) Probation, conditional discharge, periodic imprisonment and supervision shall not be revoked for failure to comply with conditions of a sentence or supervision, which imposes financial obligations upon the offender unless such failure is due to his willful refusal to pay.

<p class="subsection">
(e) If the court finds that the offender has violated a condition at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period, it may continue him on the existing sentence, with or without modifying or enlarging the conditions, or may impose any other sentence that was available under Article 4.5 of Chapter V of this Code or Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code at the time of initial sentencing. If the court finds that the person has failed to successfully complete his or her sentence to a county impact incarceration program, the court may impose any other sentence that was available under Article 4.5 of Chapter V of this Code or Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code at the time of initial sentencing, except for a sentence of probation or conditional discharge. If the court finds that the offender has violated paragraph (8.6) of subsection (a) of Section 5-6-3, the court shall revoke the probation of the offender. If the court finds that the offender has violated subsection (o) of Section 5-6-3.1, the court shall revoke the supervision of the offender.

(f) The conditions of probation, of conditional discharge, of supervision, or of a sentence of county impact incarceration may be modified by the court on motion of the supervising agency or on its own motion or at the request of the offender after notice and a hearing.

The amount of credit to be applied against a sentence of imprisonment or periodic imprisonment when the defendant served a term or partial term of periodic imprisonment shall be calculated upon the basis of the actual days spent in confinement rather than the duration of the term.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(i) Instead of filing a violation of probation, conditional discharge, supervision, or a sentence of county impact incarceration, an agent or employee of the supervising agency with the concurrence of his or her supervisor may serve on the defendant a Notice of Intermediate Sanctions. The Notice shall contain the technical violation or violations involved, the date or dates of the violation or violations, and the intermediate sanctions to be imposed. Upon receipt of the Notice, the defendant shall immediately accept or reject the intermediate sanctions. If the sanctions are accepted, they shall be imposed immediately. If the intermediate sanctions are rejected or the defendant does not respond to the Notice, a violation of probation, conditional discharge, supervision, or a sentence of county impact incarceration shall be immediately filed with the court. The State’s Attorney and the sentencing court shall be notified of the Notice of Sanctions. Upon successful completion of the intermediate sanctions, a court may not revoke probation, conditional discharge, supervision, or a sentence of county impact incarceration or impose additional sanctions for the same violation. A notice of intermediate sanctions may not be issued for any violation of probation, conditional discharge, supervision, or a sentence of county impact incarceration which could warrant an additional, separate felony charge. The intermediate sanctions shall include a term of home detention as provided in Article 8A of Chapter V of this Code for multiple or repeat violations of the terms and conditions of a sentence of probation, conditional discharge, or supervision.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(j) When an offender is re-sentenced after revocation of probation that was imposed in combination with a sentence of imprisonment for the same offense, the aggregate of the sentences may not exceed the maximum term authorized under Article 4.5 of Chapter V.

(k)(1) On and after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly, this subsection (k) shall apply to arrest warrants in Cook County only. An arrest warrant issued under paragraph (3) of subsection (a) when the underlying conviction is for the offense of theft, retail theft, or possession of a controlled substance shall remain active for a period not to exceed 10 years from the date the warrant was issued unless a motion to extend the warrant is filed by the office of the State’s Attorney or by, or on behalf of, the agency supervising the wanted person. A motion to extend the warrant shall be filed within one year before the warrant expiration date and notice shall be provided to the office of the sheriff.

(2) If a motion to extend a warrant issued under paragraph (3) of subsection (a) is not filed, the warrant shall be quashed and recalled as a matter of law under paragraph (1) of this subsection (k) and the wanted person’s period of probation, conditional discharge, or supervision shall terminate unsatisfactorily as a matter of law.
