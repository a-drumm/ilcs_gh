<p class="paragraph">
(1) A person not entitled to the possession of a vehicle or essential part of a vehicle to receive, possess, conceal, sell, dispose, or transfer it, knowing it to have been stolen or converted. Knowledge that a vehicle or essential part is stolen or converted may be inferred: (A) from the surrounding facts and circumstances, which would lead a reasonable person to believe that the vehicle or essential part is stolen or converted; or (B) if the person exercises exclusive unexplained possession over the stolen or converted vehicle or essential part, regardless of whether the date on which the vehicle or essential part was stolen is recent or remote;

It is an affirmative defense to subsection (a) of this Section that the person possessing, buying, selling or exchanging a plate mylar sticker or label described in this paragraph is a police officer doing so as part of his official duties, or is a manufacturer’s authorized representative who is replacing any manufacturer’s identification number plate, mylar sticker or Federal certificate label originally placed on the vehicle by the manufacturer of the vehicle or any essential part thereof;

<p class="subsection">
(a-1) A person engaged in the repair or servicing of vehicles does not violate this Chapter by knowingly possessing a manufacturer’s identification number plate for the purpose of reaffixing it on the same damaged vehicle from which it was originally taken, if the person reaffixes or intends to reaffix the original manufacturer’s identification number plate in place of the identification number plate affixed on a new dashboard that has been or will be installed in the vehicle. The person must notify the Secretary of State each time the original manufacturer’s identification number plate is reaffixed on a vehicle. The person must keep a record indicating that the identification number plate affixed on the new dashboard has been removed and has been replaced by the manufacturer’s identification number plate originally affixed on the vehicle. The person also must keep a record regarding the status and location of the identification number plate removed from the replacement dashboard. The Secretary shall adopt rules for implementing this subsection (a-1). (a-2) The owner of a vehicle repaired under subsection (a-1) must, within 90 days of the date of the repairs, contact an officer of the Illinois State Police Vehicle Inspection Bureau and arrange for an inspection of the vehicle, by the officer or the officer’s designee, at a mutually agreed upon date and location.

Except as provided in subsection (i-2), a motorcycle returned to the person from whom it was seized must be returned in essentially the same condition it was in at the time of seizure.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(i-2) If any part or parts of a motorcycle seized under subsection (i) are found to be stolen and are removed, the seizing law enforcement agency is not required to replace the part or parts before returning the motorcycle to the person from whom it was seized.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(j) The Illinois State Police or the Secretary of State Department of Police shall notify the Secretary of State each time a manufacturer’s vehicle identification number is affixed, reaffixed, restored or restamped on any vehicle. The Secretary of State shall make the necessary changes or corrections in his records, after the proper applications and fees have been submitted, if applicable.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(k) Any vessel, vehicle or aircraft used with knowledge and consent of the owner in the commission of, or in the attempt to commit as defined in Section 8-4 of the Criminal Code of 2012, an offense prohibited by Section 4-103 of this Chapter, including transporting of a stolen vehicle or stolen vehicle parts, shall be seized by any law enforcement agency.

</p>
<p>
The court shall issue the order if the owner of the vehicle has been convicted of transporting stolen vehicles or stolen vehicle parts and the evidence establishes that the owner’s vehicle has been used in the commission of such offense.
</p>
<p>
The provisions of subsection (k) of this Section shall not apply to any vessel, vehicle or aircraft, which has been leased, rented or loaned by its owner, if the owner did not have knowledge of and consent to the use of the vessel, vehicle or aircraft in the commission of, or in an attempt to commit, an offense prohibited by Section 4-103 of this Chapter.

<p>
The Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention and Insurance Verification Council, is hereby authorized to establish and operate a Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Program as follows:
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(a) Voluntary program participation.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(b) The registered owner of a motor vehicle interested in participating in the program shall sign an informed consent agreement designed by the Secretary of State under subsection (e) of this Section indicating that the motor vehicle registered to him is not normally operated between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. The form and fee, if any, shall be submitted to the Secretary of State for processing.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(c) Upon processing the form, the Secretary of State shall issue to the registered owner a decal. The registered owner shall affix the decal in a conspicuous place on his motor vehicle as prescribed by the Secretary of State.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(d) Whenever any law enforcement officer shall see a motor vehicle displaying a decal issued under the provisions of subsection (c) of this Section being operated upon the public highways of this State between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., the officer is authorized to stop that motor vehicle and to request the driver to produce a valid driver’s license and motor vehicle registration card if required to be carried in the vehicle. Whenever the operator of a motor vehicle displaying a decal is unable to produce the documentation set forth in this Section, the police officer shall investigate further to determine if the person operating the motor vehicle is the registered owner or has the authorization of the owner to operate the vehicle.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(e) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of the Illinois State Police and Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention and Insurance Verification Council, shall design the manner and form of the informed consent agreement required under subsection (b) of this Section and the decal required under subsection (c) of this Section.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(f) The Secretary of State shall provide for the recording of registered owners of motor vehicles who participate in the program. The records shall be available to all law enforcement departments, agencies, and forces. The Secretary of State shall cooperate with and assist all law enforcement officers and other agencies in tracing or examining any questionable motor vehicles in order to determine the ownership of the motor vehicles.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(g) A fee not to exceed $10 may be charged for the informed consent form and decal provided under this Section. The fee, if any, shall be set by the Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention and Insurance Verification Council and shall be collected by the Secretary of State and deposited into the Vehicle Hijacking and Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention and Insurance Verification Trust Fund.
</p>
<p class="subsection">
(h) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of the Illinois State Police and the Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention and Insurance Verification Council shall promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this Section.
