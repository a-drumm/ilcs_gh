(6) your behavior since commitment.
</p>
<p>
You now have 60 days in which to decide whether to remain under your indeterminate sentence and continue to be eligible for parole or waive your right to parole and accept the release date established for you by the Board. If you do nothing within 60 days, you will remain under the parole system.
</p>
<p>
If you accept the release date, you may accumulate good conduct credit at the maximum rate provided under the law recently enacted.
</p>
<p>
If you feel that the release date set for you is unfair or is not based on complete information required to be considered by the Board, you may request that the Board reconsider the date. In your request you must set forth specific reasons why you feel the Board’s release date is unfair and you may submit relevant material in support of your request.
</p>
<p>
The Department of Corrections is obligated to assist you in that effort, if you ask it to do so.
</p>
<p>
The Board will notify you within 60 days whether or not it will reconsider its decision. The Board’s decision with respect to reconsidering your release date is final and cannot be appealed to any court.
</p>
<p>
If the Board decides not to reconsider your case you will have 60 days in which to decide whether to accept the release date and waive your right to parole or to continue under the parole system. If you do nothing within 60 days after you receive notification of the Board’s decision you will remain under the parole system.
</p>
<p>
If the Board decides to reconsider its decision with respect to your release date, the Board will schedule a date for reconsideration as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days from the date it receives your request, and give you at least 30 days notice. You may submit material to the Board which you believe will be helpful in deciding a proper date for your release. The Department of Corrections is obligated to assist you in that effort, if you ask it to do so.
</p>
<p>
Neither you nor your lawyer has the right to be present on the date of reconsideration, nor the right to call witnesses. However, the Board may ask you or your lawyer to appear or may ask to hear witnesses. The Board will base its determination on the same data on which it made its earlier determination, plus any new information which may be available to it.
</p>
<p>
When the Board has made its decision you will be informed of the release date. In no event will it be longer than the release date originally determined. From this date you may continue to accumulate good conduct credits at the maximum rate. You will not be able to appeal the Board’s decision to a court.
</p>
<p>
Following the Board’s reconsideration and upon being notified of your release date you will have 60 days in which to decide whether to accept the release date and waive your right to parole or to continue under the parole system. If you do nothing within 60 days after notification of the Board’s decision you will remain under the parole system.”

I have read and understood the Prisoner Review Board’s letter, and I know how and under what circumstances the Board has set my release date. I know that I will be released on that date and will be released earlier if I accumulate good conduct credit. I know that the date set by the Board is final, and can’t be appealed to a court.
