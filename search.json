He is justified in the use of any force which he reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, to be necessary to effect the arrest and of any force which he reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, to be necessary to defend himself or another from bodily harm while making the arrest. However, he is justified in using force likely to cause death or great bodily harm only when: (i) he reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or such other person; or (ii) when he reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, both that:\n\n\n(1) Such force is necessary to prevent the arrest from being defeated by resistance or escape and the officer reasonably believes that the person to be arrested is likely to cause great bodily harm to another; and\n\n\n(2) The person to be arrested committed or attempted a forcible felony which involves the infliction or threatened infliction of great bodily harm or is attempting to escape by use of a deadly weapon, or otherwise indicates that he will endanger human life or inflict great bodily harm unless arrested without delay.\n\n\nAs used in this subsection, “retreat” does not mean tactical repositioning or other de-escalation tactics.\n\n\nA peace officer is not justified in using force likely to cause death or great bodily harm when there is no longer an imminent threat of great bodily harm to the officer or another.\n\n\n(a-5) Where feasible, a peace officer shall, prior to the use of force, make reasonable efforts to identify himself or herself as a peace officer and to warn that deadly force may be used.\n\n\n(a-10) A peace officer shall not use deadly force against a person based on the danger that the person poses to himself or herself if a reasonable officer would believe the person does not pose an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm to the peace officer or to another person.\n\n\n(a-15) A peace officer shall not use deadly force against a person who is suspected of committing a property offense, unless that offense is terrorism or unless deadly force is otherwise authorized by law.\n\n\n(b) A peace officer making an arrest pursuant to an invalid warrant is justified in the use of any force which he would be justified in using if the warrant were valid, unless he knows that the warrant is invalid.\n\n\n(c) The authority to use physical force conferred on peace officers by this Article is a serious responsibility that shall be exercised judiciously and with respect for human rights and dignity and for the sanctity of every human life.\n\n\n(d) Peace officers shall use deadly force only when reasonably necessary in defense of human life. In determining whether deadly force is reasonably necessary, officers shall evaluate each situation in light of the totality of circumstances of each case, including, but not limited to, the proximity in time of the use of force to the commission of a forcible felony, and the reasonable feasibility of safely apprehending a subject at a later time, and shall use other available resources and techniques, if reasonably safe and feasible to a reasonable officer.\n\n\n(e) The decision by a peace officer to use force shall be evaluated carefully and thoroughly, in a manner that reflects the gravity of that authority and the serious consequences of the use of force by peace officers, in order to ensure that officers use force consistent with law and agency policies.\n\n\n(f) The decision by a peace officer to use force shall be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer in the same situation, based on the totality of the circumstances known to or perceived by the officer at the time of the decision, rather than with the benefit of hindsight, and that the totality of the circumstances shall account for occasions when officers may be forced to make quick judgments about using force.\n\n\n(g) Law enforcement agencies are encouraged to adopt and develop policies designed to protect individuals with physical, mental health, developmental, or intellectual disabilities, or individuals who are significantly more likely to experience greater levels of physical force during police interactions, as these disabilities may affect the ability of a person to understand or comply with commands from peace officers.\n\n\n(h) As used in this Section:\n\n\n(1) “Deadly force” means any use of force that creates a substantial risk of causing death or great bodily harm, including, but not limited to, the discharge of a firearm.\n\n\n(2) A threat of death or serious bodily injury is\n\n\n“imminent” when, based on the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or great bodily harm to the peace officer or another person. An imminent harm is not merely a fear of future harm, no matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm, but is one that, from appearances, must be instantly confronted and addressed.\n\n\n(3) “Totality of the circumstances” means all facts known to the peace officer at the time, or that would be known to a reasonable officer in the same situation, including the conduct of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of deadly force.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-28, eff. 6-25-21; 102-687, eff. 12-17-21.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/7-5.5)"

A defendant who has been found guilty of first degree murder and who at the time of the commission of the offense had attained the age of 18 years or more may be sentenced to natural life imprisonment if (i) the murdered individual was a physician, physician assistant, psychologist, nurse, or advanced practice registered nurse, (ii) the defendant knew or should have known that the murdered individual was a physician, physician assistant, psychologist, nurse, or advanced practice registered nurse, and (iii) the murdered individual was killed in the course of acting in his or her capacity as a physician, physician assistant, psychologist, nurse, or advanced practice registered nurse, or to prevent him or her from acting in that capacity, or in retaliation for his or her acting in that capacity.\n\n\n(c) Consideration of factors in Aggravation and Mitigation.\n\n\nThe court shall consider, or shall instruct the jury to consider any aggravating and any mitigating factors which are relevant to the imposition of the death penalty. Aggravating factors may include but need not be limited to those factors set forth in subsection (b). Mitigating factors may include but need not be limited to the following:\n\n\n(1) the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity;\n\n\n(2) the murder was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, although not such as to constitute a defense to prosecution;\n\n\n(3) the murdered individual was a participant in the defendant’s homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act;\n\n\n(4) the defendant acted under the compulsion of threat or menace of the imminent infliction of death or great bodily harm;\n\n\n(5) the defendant was not personally present during commission of the act or acts causing death;\n\n\n(6) the defendant’s background includes a history of extreme emotional or physical abuse;\n\n\n(7) the defendant suffers from a reduced mental capacity.\n\n\nProvided, however, that an action that does not otherwise mitigate first degree murder cannot qualify as a mitigating factor for first degree murder because of the discovery, knowledge, or disclosure of the victim’s sexual orientation as defined in Section 1-103 of the Illinois Human Rights Act.\n\n\n(d) Separate sentencing hearing.\n\n\nWhere requested by the State, the court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding to determine the existence of factors set forth in subsection (b) and to consider any aggravating or mitigating factors as indicated in subsection (c). The proceeding shall be conducted:\n\n\n(1) before the jury that determined the defendant’s guilt; or\n\n\n(2) before a jury impanelled for the purpose of the proceeding if:\n\n\nA. the defendant was convicted upon a plea of guilty; or\n\n\nB. the defendant was convicted after a trial before the court sitting without a jury; or\n\n\nC. the court for good cause shown discharges the jury that determined the defendant’s guilt; or\n\n\n(3) before the court alone if the defendant waives a jury for the separate proceeding.\n\n\n(e) Evidence and Argument.\n\n\nDuring the proceeding any information relevant to any of the factors set forth in subsection (b) may be presented by either the State or the defendant under the rules governing the admission of evidence at criminal trials. Any information relevant to any additional aggravating factors or any mitigating factors indicated in subsection (c) may be presented by the State or defendant regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing the admission of evidence at criminal trials. The State and the defendant shall be given fair opportunity to rebut any information received at the hearing.\n\n\n(f) Proof.\n\n\nThe burden of proof of establishing the existence of any of the factors set forth in subsection (b) is on the State and shall not be satisfied unless established beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n(g) Procedure - Jury.\n\n\nIf at the separate sentencing proceeding the jury finds that none of the factors set forth in subsection (b) exists, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections. If there is a unanimous finding by the jury that one or more of the factors set forth in subsection (b) exist, the jury shall consider aggravating and mitigating factors as instructed by the court and shall determine whether the sentence of death shall be imposed. If the jury determines unanimously, after weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, that death is the appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to death. If the court does not concur with the jury determination that death is the appropriate sentence, the court shall set forth reasons in writing including what facts or circumstances the court relied upon, along with any relevant documents, that compelled the court to non-concur with the sentence. This document and any attachments shall be part of the record for appellate review. The court shall be bound by the jury’s sentencing determination.\n\n\nIf after weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, one or more jurors determines that death is not the appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.\n\n\n(h) Procedure - No Jury.\n\n\nIn a proceeding before the court alone, if the court finds that none of the factors found in subsection (b) exists, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.\n\n\nIf the Court determines that one or more of the factors set forth in subsection (b) exists, the Court shall consider any aggravating and mitigating factors as indicated in subsection (c). If the Court determines, after weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, that death is the appropriate sentence, the Court shall sentence the defendant to death.\n\n\nIf the court finds that death is not the appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.\n\n\n(h-5) Decertification as a capital case.\n\n\nIn a case in which the defendant has been found guilty of first degree murder by a judge or jury, or a case on remand for resentencing, and the State seeks the death penalty as an appropriate sentence, on the court’s own motion or the written motion of the defendant, the court may decertify the case as a death penalty case if the court finds that the only evidence supporting the defendant’s conviction is the uncorroborated testimony of an informant witness, as defined in Section 115-21 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, concerning the confession or admission of the defendant or that the sole evidence against the defendant is a single eyewitness or single accomplice without any other corroborating evidence. If the court decertifies the case as a capital case under either of the grounds set forth above, the court shall issue a written finding. The State may pursue its right to appeal the decertification pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 604(a)(1). If the court does not decertify the case as a capital case, the matter shall proceed to the eligibility phase of the sentencing hearing.\n\n\n(i) Appellate Procedure.\n\n\nThe conviction and sentence of death shall be subject to automatic review by the Supreme Court. Such review shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by the Supreme Court. The Illinois Supreme Court may overturn the death sentence, and order the imposition of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections if the court finds that the death sentence is fundamentally unjust as applied to the particular case. If the Illinois Supreme Court finds that the death sentence is fundamentally unjust as applied to the particular case, independent of any procedural grounds for relief, the Illinois Supreme Court shall issue a written opinion explaining this finding.\n\n\n(j) Disposition of reversed death sentence.\n\n\nIn the event that the death penalty in this Act is held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States or of the State of Illinois, any person convicted of first degree murder shall be sentenced by the court to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.\n\n\nIn the event that any death sentence pursuant to the sentencing provisions of this Section is declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States or of the State of Illinois, the court having jurisdiction over a person previously sentenced to death shall cause the defendant to be brought before the court, and the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.\n\n\n(k) Guidelines for seeking the death penalty.\n\n\nThe Attorney General and State’s Attorneys Association shall consult on voluntary guidelines for procedures governing whether or not to seek the death penalty. The guidelines do not have the force of law and are only advisory in nature.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 100-460, eff. 1-1-18; 100-513, eff. 1-1-18; 100-863, eff. 8-14-18; 101-223, eff. 1-1-20; 101-652, eff. 7-1-21 .)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/9-1.2) (from Ch. 38, par. 9-1.2)"

    "text": "Sec. 10-5. Child abduction.\n\n(a) For purposes of this Section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n\n\n(1) “Child” means a person who, at the time the alleged violation occurred, was under the age of 18 or was a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability.\n\n\n(2) “Detains” means taking or retaining physical custody of a child, whether or not the child resists or objects.\n\n\n(2.1) “Express consent” means oral or written permission that is positive, direct, and unequivocal, requiring no inference or implication to supply its meaning.\n\n\n(2.2) “Luring” means any knowing act to solicit, entice, tempt, or attempt to attract the minor.\n\n\n(3) “Lawful custodian” means a person or persons granted legal custody of a child or entitled to physical possession of a child pursuant to a court order. It is presumed that, when the parties have never been married to each other, the mother has legal custody of the child unless a valid court order states otherwise. If an adjudication of paternity has been completed and the father has been assigned support obligations or visitation rights, such a paternity order should, for the purposes of this Section, be considered a valid court order granting custody to the mother.\n\n\n(4) “Putative father” means a man who has a reasonable belief that he is the father of a child born of a woman who is not his wife.\n\n\n(5) “Unlawful purpose” means any misdemeanor or felony violation of State law or a similar federal or sister state law or local ordinance.\n\n\n(b) A person commits the offense of child abduction when he or she does any one of the following:\n\n\n(1) Intentionally violates any terms of a valid court order granting sole or joint custody, care, or possession to another by concealing or detaining the child or removing the child from the jurisdiction of the court.\n\n\n(2) Intentionally violates a court order prohibiting the person from concealing or detaining the child or removing the child from the jurisdiction of the court.\n\n\n(3) Intentionally conceals, detains, or removes the child without the consent of the mother or lawful custodian of the child if the person is a putative father and either: (A) the paternity of the child has not been legally established or (B) the paternity of the child has been legally established but no orders relating to custody have been entered. Notwithstanding the presumption created by paragraph (3) of subsection (a), however, a mother commits child abduction when she intentionally conceals or removes a child, whom she has abandoned or relinquished custody of, from an unadjudicated father who has provided sole ongoing care and custody of the child in her absence.\n\n\n(4) Intentionally conceals or removes the child from a parent after filing a petition or being served with process in an action affecting marriage or paternity but prior to the issuance of a temporary or final order determining custody.\n\n\n(5) At the expiration of visitation rights outside the State, intentionally fails or refuses to return or impedes the return of the child to the lawful custodian in Illinois.\n\n\n(6) Being a parent of the child, and if the parents of that child are or have been married and there has been no court order of custody, knowingly conceals the child for 15 days, and fails to make reasonable attempts within the 15-day period to notify the other parent as to the specific whereabouts of the child, including a means by which to contact the child, or to arrange reasonable visitation or contact with the child. It is not a violation of this Section for a person fleeing domestic violence to take the child with him or her to housing provided by a domestic violence program.\n\n\n(7) Being a parent of the child, and if the parents of the child are or have been married and there has been no court order of custody, knowingly conceals, detains, or removes the child with physical force or threat of physical force.\n\n\n(8) Knowingly conceals, detains, or removes the child for payment or promise of payment at the instruction of a person who has no legal right to custody.\n\n\n(9) Knowingly retains in this State for 30 days a child removed from another state without the consent of the lawful custodian or in violation of a valid court order of custody.\n\n\n(10) Intentionally lures or attempts to lure a child:\n\n\n(A) under the age of 17 or (B) while traveling to or from a primary or secondary school into a motor vehicle, building, housetrailer, or dwelling place without the consent of the child’s parent or lawful custodian for other than a lawful purpose. For the purposes of this item (10), the trier of fact may infer that luring or attempted luring of a child under the age of 17 into a motor vehicle, building, housetrailer, or dwelling place without the express consent of the child’s parent or lawful custodian or with the intent to avoid the express consent of the child’s parent or lawful custodian was for other than a lawful purpose.\n\n\n(11) With the intent to obstruct or prevent efforts to locate the child victim of a child abduction, knowingly destroys, alters, conceals, or disguises physical evidence or furnishes false information.\n\n\n(c) It is an affirmative defense to subsections (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this Section that:\n\n\n(1) the person had custody of the child pursuant to a court order granting legal custody or visitation rights that existed at the time of the alleged violation;\n\n\n(2) the person had physical custody of the child pursuant to a court order granting legal custody or visitation rights and failed to return the child as a result of circumstances beyond his or her control, and the person notified and disclosed to the other parent or legal custodian the specific whereabouts of the child and a means by which the child could be contacted or made a reasonable attempt to notify the other parent or lawful custodian of the child of those circumstances and made the disclosure within 24 hours after the visitation period had expired and returned the child as soon as possible;\n\n\n(3) the person was fleeing an incidence or pattern of domestic violence; or\n\n\n(4) the person lured or attempted to lure a child under the age of 17 into a motor vehicle, building, housetrailer, or dwelling place for a lawful purpose in prosecutions under paragraph (10) of subsection (b).\n\n\n(d) A person convicted of child abduction under this Section is guilty of a Class 4 felony. A person convicted of child abduction under subsection (b)(10) shall undergo a sex offender evaluation prior to a sentence being imposed. A person convicted of a second or subsequent violation of paragraph (10) of subsection (b) of this Section is guilty of a Class 3 felony. A person convicted of child abduction under subsection (b)(10) when the person has a prior conviction of a sex offense as defined in the Sex Offender Registration Act or any substantially similar federal, Uniform Code of Military Justice, sister state, or foreign government offense is guilty of a Class 2 felony. It is a factor in aggravation under subsections (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this Section for which a court may impose a more severe sentence under Section 5-8-1 (730 ILCS 5/5-8-1) or Article 4.5 of Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections if, upon sentencing, the court finds evidence of any of the following aggravating factors:\n\n\n(1) that the defendant abused or neglected the child following the concealment, detention, or removal of the child;\n\n\n(2) that the defendant inflicted or threatened to inflict physical harm on a parent or lawful custodian of the child or on the child with intent to cause that parent or lawful custodian to discontinue criminal prosecution of the defendant under this Section;\n\n\n(3) that the defendant demanded payment in exchange for return of the child or demanded that he or she be relieved of the financial or legal obligation to support the child in exchange for return of the child;\n\n\n(4) that the defendant has previously been convicted of child abduction;\n\n\n(5) that the defendant committed the abduction while armed with a deadly weapon or the taking of the child resulted in serious bodily injury to another; or\n\n\n(6) that the defendant committed the abduction while in a school, regardless of the time of day or time of year; in a playground; on any conveyance owned, leased, or contracted by a school to transport students to or from school or a school related activity; on the real property of a school; or on a public way within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising any school or playground. For purposes of this paragraph (6), “playground” means a piece of land owned or controlled by a unit of local government that is designated by the unit of local government for use solely or primarily for children’s recreation; and “school” means a public or private elementary or secondary school, community college, college, or university.\n\n\n(e) The court may order the child to be returned to the parent or lawful custodian from whom the child was concealed, detained, or removed. In addition to any sentence imposed, the court may assess any reasonable expense incurred in searching for or returning the child against any person convicted of violating this Section.\n\n\n(f) Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to limit the court’s contempt power.\n\n\n(g) Every law enforcement officer investigating an alleged incident of child abduction shall make a written police report of any bona fide allegation and the disposition of that investigation. Every police report completed pursuant to this Section shall be compiled and recorded within the meaning of Section 5.1 of the Criminal Identification Act.\n\n\n(h) Whenever a law enforcement officer has reasons to believe a child abduction has occurred, she or he shall provide the lawful custodian a summary of her or his rights under this Code, including the procedures and relief available to her or him.\n\n\n(i) If during the course of an investigation under this Section the child is found in the physical custody of the defendant or another, the law enforcement officer shall return the child to the parent or lawful custodian from whom the child was concealed, detained, or removed, unless there is good cause for the law enforcement officer or the Department of Children and Family Services to retain temporary protective custody of the child pursuant to the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act.\n\n\n(Source:\n\n\nP.A. 99-143, eff. 7-27-15.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/10-5.1)"

A second or subsequent offense is a Class 4 felony.\n\n\n(e) Permissive Inference.\n\n\nThe trier of fact may infer an intent to disseminate from the creation, purchase, procurement or possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than 3 copies of obscene material.\n\n\n(f) Affirmative Defenses.\n\n\nIt shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity that the dissemination:\n\n\n(1) Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than children under 18 years of age;\n\n\n(2) Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other special justification for possession of such material.\n\n\n(g) Forfeiture of property.

For the purposes of this Section:\n\n\n(1) “Disseminate” means (i) to sell, distribute, exchange or transfer possession, whether with or without consideration or (ii) to make a depiction by computer available for distribution or downloading through the facilities of any telecommunications network or through any other means of transferring computer programs or data to a computer.\n\n\n(2) “Produce” means to direct, promote, advertise, publish, manufacture, issue, present or show.\n\n\n(3) “Reproduce” means to make a duplication or copy.\n\n\n(4) “Depict by computer” means to generate or create, or cause to be created or generated, a computer program or data that, after being processed by a computer either alone or in conjunction with one or more computer programs, results in a visual depiction on a computer monitor, screen, or display.\n\n\n(5) “Depiction by computer” means a computer program or data that, after being processed by a computer either alone or in conjunction with one or more computer programs, results in a visual depiction on a computer monitor, screen, or display.\n\n\n(6) “Computer”, “computer program”, and “data” have the meanings ascribed to them in Section 17.05 of this Code.\n\n\n(7) For the purposes of this Section, “child pornography” includes a film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual medium or reproduction or depiction by computer that is, or appears to be, that of a person, either in part, or in total, under the age of 18 or a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability, regardless of the method by which the film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual medium or reproduction or depiction by computer is created, adopted, or modified to appear as such. “Child pornography” also includes a film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual medium or reproduction or depiction by computer that is advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression that the film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual medium or reproduction or depiction by computer is of a person under the age of 18 or a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability.\n\n\n(g) Re-enactment; findings; purposes.\n\n\n(1) The General Assembly finds and declares that:\n\n\n(i) Section 50-5 of Public Act 88-680, effective\n\n\nJanuary 1, 1995, contained provisions amending the child pornography statute, Section 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961. Section 50-5 also contained other provisions.\n\n\n(ii) In addition, Public Act 88-680 was entitled\n\n\n“AN ACT to create a Safe Neighborhoods Law”. (A) Article 5 was entitled JUVENILE JUSTICE and amended the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. (B) Article 15 was entitled GANGS and amended various provisions of the Criminal Code of 1961 and the Unified Code of Corrections. (C) Article 20 was entitled ALCOHOL ABUSE and amended various provisions of the Illinois Vehicle Code. (D) Article 25 was entitled DRUG ABUSE and amended the Cannabis Control Act and the Illinois Controlled Substances Act. (E) Article 30 was entitled FIREARMS and amended the Criminal Code of 1961 and the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. (F) Article 35 amended the Criminal Code of 1961, the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and the Unified Code of Corrections.

Dainty, 701 N.E. 2d 118, ruled that Public Act 88-680 violates the single subject clause of the Illinois Constitution (Article IV, Section 8 (d)) and was unconstitutional in its entirety. As of the time this amendatory Act of 1999 was prepared, People v. Dainty was still subject to appeal.\n\n\n(iv) Child pornography is a vital concern to the people of this State and the validity of future prosecutions under the child pornography statute of the Criminal Code of 1961 is in grave doubt.\n\n\n(2) It is the purpose of this amendatory Act of 1999 to prevent or minimize any problems relating to prosecutions for child pornography that may result from challenges to the constitutional validity of Public Act 88-680 by re-enacting the Section relating to child pornography that was included in Public Act 88-680.\n\n\n(3) This amendatory Act of 1999 re-enacts Section\n\n\n11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961, as it has been amended. This re-enactment is intended to remove any question as to the validity or content of that Section; it is not intended to supersede any other Public Act that amends the text of the Section as set forth in this amendatory Act of 1999. The material is shown as existing text (i.e., without underscoring) because, as of the time this amendatory Act of 1999 was prepared, People v. Dainty was subject to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.\n\n\n(4) The re-enactment by this amendatory Act of 1999 of Section 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961 relating to child pornography that was amended by Public Act 88-680 is not intended, and shall not be construed, to imply that Public Act 88-680 is invalid or to limit or impair any legal argument concerning whether those provisions were substantially re-enacted by other Public Acts.\n\n\n(Source:\n\n\nP.A. 101-87, eff. 1-1-20; 102-567, eff. 1-1-22 .)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/11-20.1A)"

There shall be a presumption of validity when an order is certified and appears authentic on its face.\n\n\n(a-3) For purposes of this Section, a “stalking no contact order” may have been issued in a criminal or civil proceeding.\n\n\n(a-5) Failure to provide reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard shall be an affirmative defense to any charge or process filed seeking enforcement of a foreign stalking no contact order.\n\n\n(b) Prosecution for a violation of a stalking no contact order shall not bar a concurrent prosecution for any other crime, including any crime that may have been committed at the time of the violation of the civil no contact order.\n\n\n(c) Nothing in this Section shall be construed to diminish the inherent authority of the courts to enforce their lawful orders through civil or criminal contempt proceedings.\n\n\n(d) A defendant who directed the actions of a third party to violate this Section, under the principles of accountability set forth in Article 5 of this Code, is guilty of violating this Section as if the same had been personally done by the defendant, without regard to the mental state of the third party acting at the direction of the defendant.\n\n\n(e) Sentence. A violation of a stalking no contact order is a Class A misdemeanor for a first violation, and a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent violation.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 100-199, eff. 1-1-18 .)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/12-4)\n\n(This Section was renumbered as Section 12-3.05 by P.A. 96-1551.)"

Injunction in connection with criminal housing management or aggravated criminal housing management.\n\n(a) In addition to any other remedies, the State’s Attorney of the county where the residential property which endangers the health or safety of any person exists is authorized to file a complaint and apply to the circuit court for a temporary restraining order, and such circuit court shall upon hearing grant a temporary restraining order or a preliminary or permanent injunction, without bond, restraining any person who owns, manages, or has any equitable interest in the property, from collecting, receiving or benefiting from any rents or other monies available from the property, so long as the property remains in a condition which endangers the health or safety of any person.\n\n\n(b) The court may order any rents or other monies owed to be paid into an escrow account. The funds are to be paid out of the escrow account only to satisfy the reasonable cost of necessary repairs of the property which had been incurred or will be incurred in ameliorating the condition of the property as described in subsection (a), payment of delinquent real estate taxes on the property or payment of other legal debts relating to the property. The court may order that funds remain in escrow for a reasonable time after the completion of all necessary repairs to assure continued upkeep of the property and satisfaction of other outstanding legal debts of the property.\n\n\n(c) The owner shall be responsible for contracting to have necessary repairs completed and shall be required to submit all bills, together with certificates of completion, to the manager of the escrow account within 30 days after their receipt by the owner.\n\n\n(d) In contracting for any repairs required pursuant to this Section the owner of the property shall enter into a contract only after receiving bids from at least 3 independent contractors capable of making the necessary repairs. If the owner does not contract for the repairs with the lowest bidder, he shall file an affidavit with the court explaining why the lowest bid was not acceptable. At no time, under the provisions of this Section, shall the owner contract with anyone who is not a licensed contractor, except that a contractor need not be licensed if neither the State nor the county, township, or municipality where the residential real estate is located requires that the contractor be licensed. The court may order release of those funds in the escrow account that are in excess of the monies that the court determines to its satisfaction are needed to correct the condition of the property as described in subsection (a).\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Section, “licensed contractor” means: (i) a contractor licensed by the State, if the State requires the licensure of the contractor; or (ii) a contractor licensed by the county, township, or municipality where the residential real estate is located, if that jurisdiction requires the licensure of the contractor.\n\n\n(e) The Clerk of the Circuit Court shall maintain a separate trust account entitled “Property Improvement Trust Account”, which shall serve as the depository for the escrowed funds prescribed by this Section. The Clerk of the Court shall be responsible for the receipt, disbursement, monitoring and maintenance of all funds entrusted to this account, and shall provide to the court a quarterly accounting of the activities for any property, with funds in such account, unless the court orders accountings on a more frequent basis.\n\n\nThe Clerk of the Circuit Court shall promulgate rules and procedures to administer the provisions of this Act.\n\n\n(f) Nothing in this Section shall in any way be construed to limit or alter any existing liability incurred, or to be incurred, by the owner or manager except as expressly provided in this Act. Nor shall anything in this Section be construed to create any liability on behalf of the Clerk of the Court, the State’s Attorney’s office or any other governmental agency involved in this action.\n\n\nNor shall anything in this Section be construed to authorize tenants to refrain from paying rent.\n\n\n(g) Costs. As part of the costs of an action under this Section, the court shall assess a reasonable fee against the defendant to be paid to the Clerk of the Circuit Court. This amount is to be used solely for the maintenance of the Property Improvement Trust Account. No money obtained directly or indirectly from the property subject to the case may be used to satisfy this cost.\n\n\n(h) The municipal building department or other entity responsible for inspection of property and the enforcement of such local requirements shall, within 5 business days of a request by the State’s Attorney, provide all documents requested, which shall include, but not be limited to, all records of inspections, permits and other information relating to any property.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 96-1551, eff. 7-1-11 .)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/12-5.3)\n\n(was 720 ILCS 5/12-2.6)"

The court shall review the petition for leave to pay attorney’s fees, and if the court determines that the fees requested are reasonable, the court shall permit the petitioners to pay them.

permissive inference. The trier of fact may infer evidence that a person intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use or benefit of the property (1) if a lessee of the personal property of another fails to return it to the owner within 10 days after written demand from the owner for its return or (2) if a lessee of the personal property of another fails to return it to the owner within 24 hours after written demand from the owner for its return and the lessee had presented identification to the owner that contained a materially fictitious name, address, or telephone number. A notice in writing, given after the expiration of the leasing agreement, addressed and mailed, by registered mail, to the lessee at the address given by him and shown on the leasing agreement shall constitute proper demand.\n\n\n(e) Permissive inference; evidence of intent that a person obtains by deception control over property. The trier of fact may infer that a person “knowingly obtains by deception control over property of the owner” when he or she fails to return, within 45 days after written demand from the owner, the downpayment and any additional payments accepted under a promise, oral or in writing, to perform services for the owner for consideration of $3,000 or more, and the promisor knowingly without good cause failed to substantially perform pursuant to the agreement after taking a down payment of 10% or more of the agreed upon consideration. This provision shall not apply where the owner initiated the suspension of performance under the agreement, or where the promisor responds to the notice within the 45-day notice period. A notice in writing, addressed and mailed, by registered mail, to the promisor at the last known address of the promisor, shall constitute proper demand.\n\n\n(f) Offender’s interest in the property.\n\n\n(1) It is no defense to a charge of theft of property that the offender has an interest therein, when the owner also has an interest to which the offender is not entitled.\n\n\n(2) Where the property involved is that of the offender’s spouse, no prosecution for theft may be maintained unless the parties were not living together as man and wife and were living in separate abodes at the time of the alleged theft.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-394, eff. 1-1-20 .)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/16-1.1)"

Each individual manufacture, sale, distribution, vending, circulation, performance, lease, possession, or other dealing in and with an unidentified sound or audio visual recording under subsection (b) of this Section constitutes a separate violation of this Section.\n\n\n(i) Any sound or audio visual recordings containing transferred sounds or a performance whose transfer was not authorized by the owner of the master sound recording or performance, or any unidentified sound or audio visual recording used, in violation of this Section, or in the attempt to commit such violation as defined in Section 8-4, or in a conspiracy to commit such violation as defined in Section 8-2, or in a solicitation to commit such offense as defined in Section 8-1, may be confiscated and destroyed upon conclusion of the case or cases to which they are relevant, except that the court may enter an order preserving them as evidence for use in other cases or pending the final determination of an appeal.\n\n\n(j) It is an affirmative defense to any charge of unlawful use of recorded sounds or images that the recorded sounds or images so used are public domain material. For purposes of this Section, recorded sounds are deemed to be in the public domain if the recorded sounds were copyrighted pursuant to the copyright laws of the United States, as the same may be amended from time to time, and the term of the copyright and any extensions or renewals thereof has expired.\n\n\n(k) With respect to sound recordings (other than accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work), this Section applies only to sound recordings that were initially recorded before February 15, 1972.\n\n\n(Source:\n\n\nP.A. 97-538, eff. 1-1-12; 97-597, eff. 1-1-12; 97-1109, eff. 1-1-13.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/16-8)"

Retail theft.\n\n(a) A person commits retail theft when he or she knowingly:\n\n\n(1) Takes possession of, carries away, transfers or causes to be carried away or transferred any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment with the intention of retaining such merchandise or with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail value of such merchandise; or\n\n\n(2) Alters, transfers, or removes any label, price tag, marking, indicia of value or any other markings which aid in determining value affixed to any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment and attempts to purchase such merchandise at less than the full retail value with the intention of depriving the merchant of the full retail value of such merchandise; or\n\n\n(3) Transfers any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment from the container in or on which such merchandise is displayed to any other container with the intention of depriving the merchant of the full retail value of such merchandise; or\n\n\n(4) Under-rings with the intention of depriving the merchant of the full retail value of the merchandise; or\n\n\n(5) Removes a shopping cart from the premises of a retail mercantile establishment without the consent of the merchant given at the time of such removal with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the possession, use or benefit of such cart; or\n\n\n(6) Represents to a merchant that he, she, or another is the lawful owner of property, knowing that such representation is false, and conveys or attempts to convey that property to a merchant who is the owner of the property in exchange for money, merchandise credit or other property of the merchant; or\n\n\n(7) Uses or possesses any theft detection shielding device or theft detection device remover with the intention of using such device to deprive the merchant permanently of the possession, use or benefit of any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment without paying the full retail value of such merchandise; or\n\n\n(8) Obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner and thereby intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use or benefit of the property when a lessee of the personal property of another fails to return it to the owner, or if the lessee fails to pay the full retail value of such property to the lessor in satisfaction of any contractual provision requiring such, within 10 days after written demand from the owner for its return. A notice in writing, given after the expiration of the leasing agreement, by registered mail, to the lessee at the address given by the lessee and shown on the leasing agreement shall constitute proper demand.\n\n\n(b) Theft by emergency exit. A person commits theft by emergency exit when he or she commits a retail theft as defined in subdivisions (a)(1) through (a)(8) of this Section and to facilitate the theft he or she leaves the retail mercantile establishment by use of a designated emergency exit.\n\n\n(c) Permissive inference. If any person:\n\n\n(1) conceals upon his or her person or among his or her belongings unpurchased merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment; and\n\n\nstation for receiving payments for that merchandise in that retail mercantile establishment, then the trier of fact may infer that the person possessed, carried away or transferred such merchandise with the intention of retaining it or with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail value of such merchandise.\n\n\nTo “conceal” merchandise means that, although there may be some notice of its presence, that merchandise is not visible through ordinary observation.\n\n\n(d) Venue. Multiple thefts committed by the same person as part of a continuing course of conduct in different jurisdictions that have been aggregated in one jurisdiction may be prosecuted in any jurisdiction in which one or more of the thefts occurred.\n\n\n(e) For the purposes of this Section, “theft detection shielding device” means any laminated or coated bag or device designed and intended to shield merchandise from detection by an electronic or magnetic theft alarm sensor.\n\n\n(f) Sentence.\n\n\n(1) A violation of any of subdivisions (a)(1) through\n\n\n(a)(6) and (a)(8) of this Section, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300 for property other than motor fuel or $150 for motor fuel, is a Class A misdemeanor. A violation of subdivision (a)(7) of this Section is a Class A misdemeanor for a first offense and a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent offense. Theft by emergency exit of property, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300, is a Class 4 felony.\n\n\n(2) A person who has been convicted of retail theft of property under any of subdivisions (a)(1) through (a)(6) and (a)(8) of this Section, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300 for property other than motor fuel or $150 for motor fuel, and who has been previously convicted of any type of theft, robbery, armed robbery, burglary, residential burglary, possession of burglary tools, home invasion, unlawful use of a credit card, or forgery is guilty of a Class 4 felony.

A person shall be deemed to have been authorized to possess, transfer, negotiate, or present for payment such item if the person was otherwise entitled by law to withdraw or recover funds from the account in question and followed the requisite procedures under the law. If the account holder, upon discovery of the withdrawal or payment, claims that the withdrawal or payment was not authorized, the financial institution may require the account holder to submit an affidavit to that effect on a form satisfactory to the financial institution before the financial institution may be required to credit the account in an amount equal to the amount or amounts that were withdrawn or paid without authorization.\n\n\n(3) Possession of implements of check fraud.\n\n\nA person commits possession of implements of check fraud when he or she possesses, with the intent to defraud and without the authority of the account holder or financial institution, any check imprinter, signature imprinter, or “certified” stamp.\n\n\n(D) Sentence.\n\n\n(1) The commission of a deceptive practice in violation of this Section, except as otherwise provided by this subsection (D), is a Class A misdemeanor.\n\n\n(2) For purposes of paragraphs (A)(1) and (B)(1):\n\n\n(a) The commission of a deceptive practice in violation of paragraph (A)(1) or (B)(1), when the value of the property so obtained, in a single transaction or in separate transactions within a 90-day period, exceeds $150, is a Class 4 felony. In the case of a prosecution for separate transactions totaling more than $150 within a 90-day period, those separate transactions shall be alleged in a single charge and prosecuted in a single prosecution.\n\n\n(b) The commission of a deceptive practice in violation of paragraph (B)(1) a second or subsequent time is a Class 4 felony.\n\n\n(3) For purposes of paragraph (C)(2), a person who, within any 12-month period, violates paragraph (C)(2) with respect to 3 or more checks or orders for the payment of money at the same time or consecutively, each the property of a different account holder or financial institution, is guilty of a Class 4 felony.\n\n\n(4) For purposes of paragraph (C)(3), a person who within any 12-month period violates paragraph (C)(3) as to possession of 3 or more such devices at the same time or consecutively is guilty of a Class 4 felony.\n\n\n(E) Civil liability.

State’s Attorney’s bad check diversion program.\n\n(a) In this Section:\n\n\n“Offender” means a person charged with, or for whom probable cause exists to charge the person with, deceptive practices.\n\n\n“Pretrial diversion” means the decision of a prosecutor to refer an offender to a diversion program on condition that the criminal charges against the offender will be dismissed after a specified period of time, or the case will not be charged, if the offender successfully completes the program.\n\n\n“Restitution” means all amounts payable to a victim of deceptive practices under the bad check diversion program created under this Section, including the amount of the check and any transaction fees payable to a victim as set forth in subsection (g) but does not include amounts recoverable under Section 3-806 of the Uniform Commercial Code and subsection (E) of Section 17-1 of this Code.\n\n\n(b) A State’s Attorney may create within his or her office a bad check diversion program for offenders who agree to voluntarily participate in the program instead of undergoing prosecution. The program may be conducted by the State’s Attorney or by a private entity under contract with the State’s Attorney. If the State’s Attorney contracts with a private entity to perform any services in operating the program, the entity shall operate under the supervision, direction, and control of the State’s Attorney. Any private entity providing services under this Section is not a “collection agency” as that term is defined under the Collection Agency Act.\n\n\n(c) If an offender is referred to the State’s Attorney, the State’s Attorney may determine whether the offender is appropriate for acceptance in the program. The State’s Attorney may consider, but shall not be limited to consideration of, the following factors:\n\n\n(1) the amount of the check that was drawn or passed;\n\n\n(2) prior referrals of the offender to the program;\n\n\n(3) whether other charges of deceptive practices are pending against the offender;\n\n\n(4) the evidence presented to the State’s Attorney regarding the facts and circumstances of the incident;\n\n\n(5) the offender’s criminal history; and\n\n\n(6) the reason the check was dishonored by the financial institution.\n\n\n(d) The bad check diversion program may require an offender to do one or more of the following:\n\n\n(i) pay for, at his or her own expense, and successfully complete an educational class held by the State’s Attorney or a private entity under contract with the State’s Attorney;\n\n\n(ii) make full restitution for the offense;\n\n\n(iii) pay a per-check administrative fee as set forth in this Section.\n\n\n(e) If an offender is diverted to the program, the State’s Attorney shall agree in writing not to prosecute the offender upon the offender’s successful completion of the program conditions. The State’s Attorney’s agreement to divert the offender shall specify the offenses that will not be prosecuted by identifying the checks involved in the transactions.\n\n\n(f) The State’s Attorney, or private entity under contract with the State’s Attorney, may collect a fee from an offender diverted to the State’s Attorney’s bad check diversion program. This fee may be deposited in a bank account maintained by the State’s Attorney for the purpose of depositing fees and paying the expenses of the program or for use in the enforcement and prosecution of criminal laws. The State’s Attorney may require that the fee be paid directly to a private entity that administers the program under a contract with the State’s Attorney. The amount of the administrative fees collected by the State’s Attorney under the program may not exceed $35 per check. The county board may, however, by ordinance, increase the fees allowed by this Section if the increase is justified by an acceptable cost study showing that the fees allowed by this Section are not sufficient to cover the cost of providing the service.\n\n\n(g)\n\n\n(1) The private entity shall be required to maintain adequate general liability insurance of $1,000,000 per occurrence as well as adequate coverage for potential loss resulting from employee dishonesty. The State’s Attorney may require a surety bond payable to the State’s Attorney if in the State’s Attorney’s opinion it is determined that the private entity is not adequately insured or funded.\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n(A) Each private entity that has a contract with the State’s Attorney to conduct a bad check diversion program shall at all times maintain a separate bank account in which all moneys received from the offenders participating in the program shall be deposited, referred to as a “trust account”, except that negotiable instruments received may be forwarded directly to a victim of the deceptive practice committed by the offender if that procedure is provided for by a writing executed by the victim. Moneys received shall be so deposited within 5 business days after posting to the private entity’s books of account. There shall be sufficient funds in the trust account at all times to pay the victims the amount due them.\n\n\n(B) The trust account shall be established in a financial institution which is federally or State insured or otherwise secured as defined by rule. If the account is interest bearing, the private entity shall pay to the victim interest earned on funds on deposit after the 60th day.\n\n\n(C) Each private entity shall keep on file the name of the financial institution in which each trust account is maintained, the name of each trust account, and the names of the persons authorized to withdraw funds from each account. The private entity, within 30 days of the time of a change of depository or person authorized to make withdrawal, shall update its files to reflect that change. An examination and audit of a private entity’s trust accounts may be made by the State’s Attorney as the State’s Attorney deems appropriate. A trust account financial report shall be submitted annually on forms acceptable to the State’s Attorney.\n\n\n(3) The State’s Attorney may cancel a contract entered into with a private entity under this Section for any one or any combination of the following causes:\n\n\n(A) Conviction of the private entity or the principals of the private entity of any crime under the laws of any U.S. jurisdiction which is a felony, a misdemeanor an essential element of which is dishonesty, or of any crime which directly relates to the practice of the profession.\n\n\n(B) A determination that the private entity has engaged in conduct prohibited in item (4).\n\n\n(4) The State’s Attorney may determine whether the private entity has engaged in the following prohibited conduct:\n\n\n(A) Using or threatening to use force or violence to cause physical harm to an offender, his or her family, or his or her property.\n\n\n(B) Threatening the seizure, attachment, or sale of an offender’s property where such action can only be taken pursuant to court order without disclosing that prior court proceedings are required.\n\n\n(C) Disclosing or threatening to disclose information adversely affecting an offender’s reputation for creditworthiness with knowledge the information is false.\n\n\n(D) Initiating or threatening to initiate communication with an offender’s employer unless there has been a default of the payment of the obligation for at least 30 days and at least 5 days prior written notice, to the last known address of the offender, of the intention to communicate with the employer has been given to the employee, except as expressly permitted by law or court order.\n\n\n(E) Communicating with the offender or any member of the offender’s family at such a time of day or night and with such frequency as to constitute harassment of the offender or any member of the offender’s family. For purposes of this clause (E) the following conduct shall constitute harassment:\n\n\n(i) Communicating with the offender or any member of his or her family at any unusual time or place or a time or place known or which should be known to be inconvenient to the offender. In the absence of knowledge of circumstances to the contrary, a private entity shall assume that the convenient time for communicating with a consumer is after 8 o’clock a.m. and before 9 o’clock p.m. local time at the offender’s residence.\n\n\n(ii) The threat of publication or publication of a list of offenders who allegedly refuse to pay restitution, except by the State’s Attorney.\n\n\n(iii) The threat of advertisement or advertisement for sale of any restitution to coerce payment of the restitution.\n\n\n(iv) Causing a telephone to ring or engaging any person in telephone conversation repeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass any person at the called number.\n\n\n(v) Using profane, obscene or abusive language in communicating with an offender, his or her family, or others.\n\n\n(vi) Disclosing or threatening to disclose information relating to a offender’s case to any other person except the victim and appropriate law enforcement personnel.\n\n\n(vii) Disclosing or threatening to disclose information concerning the alleged criminal act which the private entity knows to be reasonably disputed by the offender without disclosing the fact that the offender disputes the accusation.\n\n\n(viii) Engaging in any conduct which the\n\n\nState’s Attorney finds was intended to cause and did cause mental or physical illness to the offender or his or her family.\n\n\n(ix) Attempting or threatening to enforce a right or remedy with knowledge or reason to know that the right or remedy does not exist.\n\n\n(x) Except as authorized by the State’s\n\n\nAttorney, using any form of communication which simulates legal or judicial process or which gives the appearance of being authorized, issued or approved by a governmental agency or official or by an attorney at law when it is not.\n\n\n(xi) Using any badge, uniform, or other indicia of any governmental agency or official, except as authorized by law or by the State’s Attorney.\n\n\n(xii) Except as authorized by the State’s\n\n\nAttorney, conducting business under any name or in any manner which suggests or implies that the private entity is bonded if such private entity is or is a branch of or is affiliated with any governmental agency or court if such private entity is not.\n\n\n(xiii) Misrepresenting the amount of the restitution alleged to be owed.\n\n\n(xiv) Except as authorized by the State’s\n\n\nAttorney, representing that an existing restitution amount may be increased by the addition of attorney’s fees, investigation fees, or any other fees or charges when those fees or charges may not legally be added to the existing restitution.\n\n\n(xv) Except as authorized by the State’s\n\n\nAttorney, representing that the private entity is an attorney at law or an agent for an attorney if the entity is not.\n\n\n(xvi) Collecting or attempting to collect any interest or other charge or fee in excess of the actual restitution or claim unless the interest or other charge or fee is expressly authorized by the State’s Attorney, who shall determine what constitutes a reasonable collection fee.\n\n\n(xvii) Communicating or threatening to communicate with an offender when the private entity is informed in writing by an attorney that the attorney represents the offender concerning the claim, unless authorized by the attorney. If the attorney fails to respond within a reasonable period of time, the private entity may communicate with the offender. The private entity may communicate with the offender when the attorney gives his consent.\n\n\n(xviii) Engaging in dishonorable, unethical, or unprofessional conduct of a character likely to deceive, defraud, or harm the public.\n\n\n(5) The State’s Attorney shall audit the accounts of the bad check diversion program after notice in writing to the private entity.\n\n\n(6) Any information obtained by a private entity that has a contract with the State’s Attorney to conduct a bad check diversion program is confidential information between the State’s Attorney and the private entity and may not be sold or used for any other purpose but may be shared with other authorized law enforcement agencies as determined by the State’s Attorney.\n\n\n(h) The State’s Attorney, or private entity under contract with the State’s Attorney, shall recover, in addition to the face amount of the dishonored check or draft, a transaction fee to defray the costs and expenses incurred by a victim who received a dishonored check that was made or delivered by the offender. The face amount of the dishonored check or draft and the transaction fee shall be paid by the State’s Attorney or private entity under contract with the State’s Attorney to the victim as restitution for the offense. The amount of the transaction fee must not exceed: $25 if the face amount of the check or draft does not exceed $100; $30 if the face amount of the check or draft is greater than $100 but does not exceed $250; $35 if the face amount of the check or draft is greater than $250 but does not exceed $500; $40 if the face amount of the check or draft is greater than $500 but does not exceed $1,000; and $50 if the face amount of the check or draft is greater than $1,000.\n\n\n(i) The offender, if aggrieved by an action of the private entity contracted to operate a bad check diversion program, may submit a grievance to the State’s Attorney who may then resolve the grievance.

Criminal defacement of property is a Class 4 felony when the aggregate value of the damage to property does not exceed $500 and the property damaged is a school building or place of worship or property which memorializes or honors an individual or group of police officers, fire fighters, members of the United States Armed Forces or National Guard, or veterans. Criminal defacement of property is a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent conviction or when the aggregate value of the damage to the property exceeds $500. Criminal defacement of property is a Class 3 felony when the aggregate value of the damage to property exceeds $500 and the property damaged is a school building or place of worship or property which memorializes or honors an individual or group of police officers, fire fighters, members of the United States Armed Forces or National Guard, or veterans.\n\n\n(2) In addition to any other sentence that may be imposed for a violation of this Section, a person convicted of criminal defacement of property shall:\n\n\n(A) pay the actual costs incurred by the property owner or the unit of government to abate, remediate, repair, or remove the effect of the damage to the property. To the extent permitted by law, reimbursement for the costs of abatement, remediation, repair, or removal shall be payable to the person who incurred the costs; and\n\n\n(B) if convicted of criminal defacement of property that is chargeable as a Class 3 or Class 4 felony, pay a mandatory minimum fine of $500.\n\n\n(3) In addition to any other sentence that may be imposed, a court shall order any person convicted of criminal defacement of property to perform community service for not less than 30 and not more than 120 hours, if community service is available in the jurisdiction. The community service shall include, but need not be limited to, the cleanup and repair of the damage to property that was caused by the offense, or similar damage to property located in the municipality or county in which the offense occurred. When the property damaged is a school building, the community service may include cleanup, removal, or painting over the defacement. In addition, whenever any person is placed on supervision for an alleged offense under this Section, the supervision shall be conditioned upon the performance of the community service.\n\n\n(4) For the purposes of this subsection (b), aggregate value shall be determined by adding the value of the damage to one or more properties if the offenses were committed as part of a single course of conduct.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 98-315, eff. 1-1-14; 98-466, eff. 8-16-13; 98-756, eff. 7-16-14; 99-631, eff. 1-1-17 .)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/21-1.4)"

As used in this Section, a “gambling device” includes any slot machine, and includes any machine or device constructed for the reception of money or other thing of value and so constructed as to return, or to cause someone to return, on chance to the player thereof money, property or a right to receive money or property. With the exception of any device designed for gambling which is incapable of lawful use, no gambling device shall be forfeited or destroyed unless an individual with a property interest in said device knows of the unlawful use of the device.\n\n\n(b) Every gambling device shall be seized and forfeited to the county wherein such seizure occurs. Any money or other thing of value integrally related to acts of gambling shall be seized and forfeited to the county wherein such seizure occurs.\n\n\n(c) If, within 60 days after any seizure pursuant to subparagraph (b) of this Section, a person having any property interest in the seized property is charged with an offense, the court which renders judgment upon such charge shall, within 30 days after such judgment, conduct a forfeiture hearing to determine whether such property was a gambling device at the time of seizure. Such hearing shall be commenced by a written petition by the State, including material allegations of fact, the name and address of every person determined by the State to have any property interest in the seized property, a representation that written notice of the date, time and place of such hearing has been mailed to every such person by certified mail at least 10 days before such date, and a request for forfeiture. Every such person may appear as a party and present evidence at such hearing. The quantum of proof required shall be a preponderance of the evidence, and the burden of proof shall be on the State.

Upon a final determination by the Court of this question in favor of the defendant, such slot machine shall be immediately returned to the defendant. Such order of forfeiture and disposition shall, for the purposes of appeal, be a final order and judgment in a civil proceeding.\n\n\n(d) If a seizure pursuant to subparagraph (b) of this Section is not followed by a charge pursuant to subparagraph (c) of this Section, or if the prosecution of such charge is permanently terminated or indefinitely discontinued without any judgment of conviction or acquittal (1) the State’s Attorney shall commence an in rem proceeding for the forfeiture and destruction of a gambling device, or for the forfeiture and deposit in the general fund of the county of any seized money or other things of value, or both, in the circuit court and (2) any person having any property interest in such seized gambling device, money or other thing of value may commence separate civil proceedings in the manner provided by law.\n\n\n(e) Any gambling device displayed for sale to a riverboat gambling operation, casino gambling operation, or organization gaming facility or used to train occupational licensees of a riverboat gambling operation, casino gambling operation, or organization gaming facility as authorized under the Illinois Gambling Act is exempt from seizure under this Section.\n\n\n(f) Any gambling equipment, devices, and supplies provided by a licensed supplier in accordance with the Illinois Gambling Act which are removed from a riverboat, casino, or organization gaming facility for repair are exempt from seizure under this Section.\n\n\n(g) The following video gaming terminals are exempt from seizure under this Section:\n\n\n(1) Video gaming terminals for sale to a licensed distributor or operator under the Video Gaming Act.\n\n\n(2) Video gaming terminals used to train licensed technicians or licensed terminal handlers.\n\n\n(3) Video gaming terminals that are removed from a licensed establishment, licensed truck stop establishment, licensed large truck stop establishment, licensed fraternal establishment, or licensed veterans establishment for repair.\n\n\n(h) Property seized or forfeited under this Section is subject to reporting under the Seizure and Forfeiture Reporting Act.\n\n\n(i) Any sports lottery terminals provided by a central system provider that are removed from a lottery retailer for repair under the Sports Wagering Act are exempt from seizure under this Section.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-31, Article 25, Section 25-915, eff. 6-28-19; 101-31, Article 35, Section 35-80, eff. 6-28-19; 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/28-7) (from Ch. 38, par. 28-7)"

The attempts at service and the posting, if required, shall be documented by the person attempting service which shall be made part of a return of service returned to the State’s Attorney.

The complaint shall be accompanied by the following written notice:\n\n\n“This is a civil court proceeding subject to the Code of Civil Procedure. You received this Complaint of Forfeiture because the State’s Attorney’s office has brought a legal action seeking forfeiture of your seized property. This complaint starts the court process where the State seeks to prove that your property should be forfeited and not returned to you. This process is also your opportunity to try to prove to a judge that you should get your property back. The complaint lists the date, time, and location of your first court date. You must appear in court on that day, or you may lose the case automatically. You must also file an appearance and answer. If you are unable to pay the appearance fee, you may qualify to have the fee waived. If there is a criminal case related to the seizure of your property, your case may be set for trial after the criminal case has been resolved. Before trial, the judge may allow discovery, where the State can ask you to respond in writing to questions and give them certain documents, and you can make similar requests of the State. The trial is your opportunity to explain what happened when your property was seized and why you should get the property back.”\n\n\n(4) Forfeiture proceedings under this Article shall be subject to the Code of Civil Procedure and the rules of evidence relating to civil actions shall apply to proceedings under this Article with the following exception.

For purposes of this Section, the owner or interest holder shall be referred to as claimant. Upon motion of the State, the court shall first hold a hearing, in which a claimant shall establish by a preponderance of the evidence, that he or she has a lawful, legitimate ownership interest in the property and that it was obtained through a lawful source.\n\n\n(6) The answer must be signed by the owner or interest holder under penalty of perjury and shall set forth:\n\n\n(A) the caption of the proceedings as set forth on the notice of pending forfeiture and the name of the claimant;\n\n\n(B) the address at which the claimant will accept mail;\n\n\n(C) the nature and extent of the claimant’s interest in the property;\n\n\n(D) the date, identity of transferor, and circumstances of the claimant’s acquisition of the interest in the property;\n\n\n(E) the names and addresses of all other persons known to have an interest in the property;\n\n\n(F) all essential facts supporting each assertion;\n\n\n(G) the precise relief sought; and\n\n\n(H) in a forfeiture action involving currency or its equivalent, a claimant shall provide the State with notice of his or her intent to allege that the currency or its equivalent is not related to the alleged factual basis for the forfeiture, and why.\n\n\nThe answer shall follow the rules under the Code of\n\n\nCivil Procedure.\n\n\n(7) The answer shall be filed with the court within\n\n\n45 days after service of the civil in rem complaint.\n\n\n(8) The hearing shall be held within 60 days after filing of the answer unless continued for good cause.\n\n\n(9) At the judicial in rem proceeding, in the State’s case in chief, the State shall show by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture. If the State makes such a showing, the claimant shall have the burden of production to set forth evidence that the property is not related to the alleged factual basis of the forfeiture. After this production of evidence, the State shall maintain the burden of proof to overcome this assertion. A claimant shall provide the State notice of its intent to allege that the currency or its equivalent is not related to the alleged factual basis of the forfeiture and why. As to conveyances, at the judicial in rem proceeding, in its case in chief, the State shall show by a preponderance of the evidence:\n\n\n(A) that the property is subject to forfeiture; and\n\n\n(B) at least one of the following:\n\n\n(i) that the claimant was legally accountable for the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture;\n\n\n(ii) that the claimant knew or reasonably should have known of the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture;\n\n\n(iii) that the claimant knew or reasonably should have known that the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture was likely to occur;\n\n\n(iv) that the claimant held the property for the benefit of, or as nominee for, any person whose conduct gave rise to its forfeiture;\n\n\n(v) that if the claimant acquired the interest through any person engaging in any of the conduct described above or conduct giving rise to the forfeiture:\n\n\n(a) the claimant did not acquire it as a bona fide purchaser for value; or\n\n\n(b) the claimant acquired the interest under the circumstances that the claimant reasonably should have known the property was derived from, or used in, the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture; or\n\n\n(vi) that the claimant is not the true owner of the property that is subject to forfeiture.\n\n\n(10) If the State does not meet its burden to show that the property is subject to forfeiture, the court shall order the interest in the property returned or conveyed to the claimant and shall order all other property forfeited to the State. If the State does meet its burden to show that the property is subject to forfeiture, the court shall order all property forfeited to the State.\n\n\n(11) A defendant convicted in any criminal proceeding is precluded from later denying the essential allegations of the criminal offense of which the defendant was convicted in any proceeding under this Article regardless of the pendency of an appeal from that conviction. However, evidence of the pendency of an appeal is admissible.\n\n\n(12) On a motion by the parties, the court may stay civil forfeiture proceedings during the criminal trial for a related criminal indictment or information alleging a money laundering violation. Such a stay shall not be available pending an appeal. Property subject to forfeiture under this Article shall not be subject to return or release by a court exercising jurisdiction over a criminal case involving the seizure of the property unless the return or release is consented to by the State’s Attorney.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 100-699, eff. 8-3-18; 100-1163, eff. 12-20-18.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/29B-14)"

Accordingly, the legislature finds that our laws must be strengthened to ensure that terrorists, as well as those who solicit or provide financial and other support to terrorists, are prosecuted and punished in State courts with appropriate severity.

    "text": "Sec. 33A-1. Legislative intent and definitions.\n\n(a) Legislative findings. The legislature finds and declares the following:\n\n\n(1) The use of a dangerous weapon in the commission of a felony offense poses a much greater threat to the public health, safety, and general welfare, than when a weapon is not used in the commission of the offense.\n\n\n(2) Further, the use of a firearm greatly facilitates the commission of a criminal offense because of the more lethal nature of a firearm and the greater perceived threat produced in those confronted by a person wielding a firearm. Unlike other dangerous weapons such as knives and clubs, the use of a firearm in the commission of a criminal felony offense significantly escalates the threat and the potential for bodily harm, and the greater range of the firearm increases the potential for harm to more persons. Not only are the victims and bystanders at greater risk when a firearm is used, but also the law enforcement officers whose duty is to confront and apprehend the armed suspect.\n\n\n(3) Current law does contain offenses involving the use or discharge of a gun toward or against a person, such as aggravated battery with a firearm, aggravated discharge of a firearm, and reckless discharge of a firearm; however, the General Assembly has legislated greater penalties for the commission of a felony while in possession of a firearm because it deems such acts as more serious.\n\n\n(b) Legislative intent.\n\n\n(1) In order to deter the use of firearms in the commission of a felony offense, the General Assembly deems it appropriate for a greater penalty to be imposed when a firearm is used or discharged in the commission of an offense than the penalty imposed for using other types of weapons and for the penalty to increase on more serious offenses.\n\n\n(2) With the additional elements of the discharge of a firearm and great bodily harm inflicted by a firearm being added to armed violence and other serious felony offenses, it is the intent of the General Assembly to punish those elements more severely during commission of a felony offense than when those elements stand alone as the act of the offender.\n\n\n(3) It is the intent of the 91st General Assembly that should Public Act 88-680 be declared unconstitutional for a violation of Article 4, Section 8 of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois, the amendatory changes made by Public Act 88-680 to Article 33A of the Criminal Code of 1961 and which are set forth as law in this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly are hereby reenacted by this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly.\n\n\n(c) Definitions.\n\n\n(1) “Armed with a dangerous weapon”. A person is considered armed with a dangerous weapon for purposes of this Article, when he or she carries on or about his or her person or is otherwise armed with a Category I, Category II, or Category III weapon.\n\n\n(2) A Category I weapon is a handgun, sawed-off shotgun, sawed-off rifle, any other firearm small enough to be concealed upon the person, semiautomatic firearm, or machine gun. A Category II weapon is any other rifle, shotgun, spring gun, other firearm, stun gun or taser as defined in paragraph (a) of Section 24-1 of this Code, knife with a blade of at least 3 inches in length, dagger, dirk, switchblade knife, stiletto, axe, hatchet, or other deadly or dangerous weapon or instrument of like character. As used in this subsection (b) “semiautomatic firearm” means a repeating firearm that utilizes a portion of the energy of a firing cartridge to extract the fired cartridge case and chamber the next round and that requires a separate pull of the trigger to fire each cartridge.\n\n\n(3) A Category III weapon is a bludgeon, black-jack, slungshot, sand-bag, sand-club, metal knuckles, billy, or other dangerous weapon of like character.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 91-404, eff. 1-1-00; 91-696, eff. 4-13-00.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/33A-2) (from Ch. 38, par. 33A-2)"

No State’s Attorney, or person designated by law to act for him or her and to perform his or her duties during his or her absence or disability, may authorize a criminal prosecution under this Article prior to reviewing the prepared written prosecution memorandum.

The court shall consider the following factors in determining whether a substantial hardship has been proven:\n\n\n(1) the nature of the claimed hardship;\n\n\n(2) the availability of public transportation or other available means of transportation; and\n\n\n(3) any available alternatives to alleviate the hardship other than the return of the seized conveyance.\n\n\nIf the court determines that a substantial hardship has been proven, the court shall then balance the nature of the hardship against the State’s interest in safeguarding the conveyance. If the court determines that the hardship outweighs the State’s interest in safeguarding the conveyance, the court may temporarily release the conveyance to the registered owner or the registered owner’s authorized designee, or both, until the conclusion of the forfeiture proceedings or for such shorter period as ordered by the court provided that the person to whom the conveyance is released provides proof of insurance and a valid driver’s license and all State and local registrations for operation of the conveyance are current. The court shall place conditions on the conveyance limiting its use to the stated hardship and providing transportation for employment, religious purposes, medical needs, child care, and restricting the conveyance’s use to only those individuals authorized to use the conveyance by the registered owner. The use of the vehicle shall be further restricted to exclude all recreational and entertainment purposes. The court may order additional restrictions it deems reasonable and just on its own motion or on motion of the People. The court shall revoke the order releasing the conveyance and order that the conveyance be reseized by law enforcement if the conditions of release are violated or if the conveyance is used in the commission of any offense identified in subsection (a) of Section 6-205 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.\n\n\nIf the court orders the release of the conveyance during the pendency of the forfeiture proceedings, the court may order the registered owner or his or her authorized designee to post a cash security with the clerk of the court as ordered by the court. If cash security is ordered, the court shall consider the following factors in determining the amount of the cash security:\n\n\n(A) the full market value of the conveyance;\n\n\n(B) the nature of the hardship;\n\n\n(C) the extent and length of the usage of the conveyance;\n\n\n(D) the ability of the owner or designee to pay; and\n\n\n(E) other conditions as the court deems necessary to safeguard the conveyance.\n\n\nIf the conveyance is released, the court shall order that the registered owner or his or her designee safeguard the conveyance, not remove the conveyance from the jurisdiction, not conceal, destroy, or otherwise dispose of the conveyance, not encumber the conveyance, and not diminish the value of the conveyance in any way. The court shall also make a determination of the full market value of the conveyance prior to it being released based on a source or sources defined in 50 Ill. Adm. Code 919.80(c)(2)(A) or 919.80(c)(2)(B).\n\n\nIf the conveyance subject to forfeiture is released under this Section and is subsequently forfeited, the person to whom the conveyance was released shall return the conveyance to the law enforcement agency that seized the conveyance within 7 days from the date of the declaration of forfeiture or order of forfeiture. If the conveyance is not returned within 7 days, the cash security shall be forfeited in the same manner as the conveyance subject to forfeiture. If the cash security was less than the full market value, a judgment shall be entered against the parties to whom the conveyance was released and the registered owner, jointly and severally, for the difference between the full market value and the amount of the cash security. If the conveyance is returned in a condition other than the condition in which it was released, the cash security shall be returned to the surety who posted the security minus the amount of the diminished value, and that amount shall be forfeited in the same manner as the conveyance subject to forfeiture. Additionally, the court may enter an order allowing any law enforcement agency in the State of Illinois to seize the conveyance wherever it may be found in the State to satisfy the judgment if the cash security was less than the full market value of the conveyance.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 100-512, eff. 7-1-18; 100-699, eff. 8-3-18; 100-1163, eff. 12-20-18.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/36-1a) (from Ch. 38, par. 36-1a)"

This process is also your opportunity to try to prove to a judge that you should get your property back. The complaint lists the date, time, and location of your first court date. You must appear in court on that day, or you may lose the case automatically. You must also file an appearance and answer. If you are unable to pay the appearance fee, you may qualify to have the fee waived. If there is a criminal case related to the seizure of your property, your case may be set for trial after the criminal case has been resolved. Before trial, the judge may allow discovery, where the State can ask you to respond in writing to questions and give them certain documents, and you can make similar requests of the State.

A complaint for forfeiture shall be served upon the property owner or interest holder in the following manner:\n\n\n(1) If the owner’s or interest holder’s name and current address are known, then by either:\n\n\n(A) personal service; or\n\n\n(B) mailing a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address.\n\n\n(i) If notice is sent by certified mail and no signed return receipt is received by the State’s Attorney within 28 days of mailing, and no communication from the owner or interest holder is received by the State’s Attorney documenting actual notice by said parties, the State’s Attorney shall, within a reasonable period of time, mail a second copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address.\n\n\n(ii) If no signed return receipt is received by the State’s Attorney within 28 days of the second attempt at service by certified mail, and no communication from the owner or interest holder is received by the State’s Attorney documenting actual notice by said parties, the State’s Attorney shall have 60 days to attempt to serve the notice by personal service, which also includes substitute service by leaving a copy at the usual place of abode with some person of the family or a person residing there, of the age of 13 years or upwards. If, after 3 attempts at service in this manner, no service of the notice is accomplished, then the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous manner at this address and service shall be made by the posting.\n\n\nThe attempts at service and the posting, if required, shall be documented by the person attempting service and said documentation shall be made part of a return of service returned to the State’s Attorney.\n\n\nThe State’s Attorney may utilize a Sheriff or\n\n\nDeputy Sheriff, any peace officer, a private process server or investigator, or any employee, agent, or investigator of the State’s Attorney’s office to attempt service without seeking leave of court.\n\n\nAfter the procedures are followed, service shall be effective on an owner or interest holder on the date of receipt by the State’s Attorney of a return receipt, or on the date of receipt of a communication from an owner or interest holder documenting actual notice, whichever is first in time, or on the date of the last act performed by the State’s Attorney in attempting personal service under item (ii) of this paragraph (1). If notice is to be shown by actual notice from communication with a claimant, then the State’s Attorney shall file an affidavit providing details of the communication, which shall be accepted as sufficient proof of service by the court.\n\n\nFor purposes of notice under this Section, if a person has been arrested for the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, the address provided to the arresting agency at the time of arrest shall be deemed to be that person’s known address. Provided, however, if an owner or interest holder’s address changes prior to the effective date of the complaint for forfeiture, the owner or interest holder shall promptly notify the seizing agency of the change in address or, if the owner or interest holder’s address changes subsequent to the effective date of the notice of pending forfeiture, the owner or interest holder shall promptly notify the State’s Attorney of the change in address; or if the property seized is a conveyance, to the address reflected in the office of the agency or official in which title to or interest in the conveyance is required by law to be recorded.\n\n\n(2) If the owner’s or interest holder’s address is not known, and is not on record, then notice shall be served by publication for 3 successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the seizure occurred.\n\n\n(3) Notice to any business entity, corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or partnership shall be completed by a single mailing of a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address. This notice is complete regardless of the return of a signed return receipt.\n\n\n(4) Notice to a person whose address is not within the State shall be completed by a single mailing of a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address. This notice is complete regardless of the return of a signed return receipt.\n\n\n(5) Notice to a person whose address is not within the United States shall be completed by a single mailing of a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address. This notice shall be complete regardless of the return of a signed return receipt. If certified mail is not available in the foreign country where the person has an address, then notice shall proceed by publication under paragraph (2) of this Section.\n\n\n(6) Notice to any person whom the State’s Attorney reasonably should know is incarcerated within the State shall also include mailing a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to the address of the detention facility with the inmate’s name clearly marked on the envelope.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 100-512, eff. 7-1-18; 100-699, eff. 8-3-18; 100-1163, eff. 12-20-18.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/36-2.2)"

    "text": "Sec. 48-2. Animal research and production facilities protection.\n\n(a) Definitions.\n\n\n“Animal” means every living creature, domestic or wild, but does not include man.\n\n\n“Animal facility” means any facility engaging in legal scientific research or agricultural production of or involving the use of animals including any organization with a primary purpose of representing livestock production or processing, any organization with a primary purpose of promoting or marketing livestock or livestock products, any person licensed to practice veterinary medicine, any institution as defined in the Impounding and Disposition of Stray Animals Act, and any organization with a primary purpose of representing any such person, organization, or institution. “Animal facility” shall include the owner, operator, and employees of any animal facility and any premises where animals are located.\n\n\n“Director” means the Director of the Illinois\n\n\nDepartment of Agriculture or the Director’s authorized representative.\n\n\n(b) Legislative Declaration. There has been an increasing number of illegal acts committed against animal research and production facilities involving injury or loss of life to humans or animals, criminal trespass and damage to property. These actions not only abridge the property rights of the owner of the facility, they may also damage the public interest by jeopardizing crucial scientific, biomedical, or agricultural research or production. These actions can also threaten the public safety by possibly exposing communities to serious public health concerns and creating traffic hazards. These actions may substantially disrupt or damage publicly funded research and can result in the potential loss of physical and intellectual property. Therefore, it is in the interest of the people of the State of Illinois to protect the welfare of humans and animals as well as productive use of public funds to require regulation to prevent unauthorized possession, alteration, destruction, or transportation of research records, test data, research materials, equipment, research and agricultural production animals.\n\n\n(c) It shall be unlawful for any person:\n\n\n(1) to release, steal, or otherwise intentionally cause the death, injury, or loss of any animal at or from an animal facility and not authorized by that facility;\n\n\n(2) to damage, vandalize, or steal any property in or on an animal facility;\n\n\n(3) to obtain access to an animal facility by false pretenses for the purpose of performing acts not authorized by that facility;\n\n\n(4) to enter into an animal facility with an intent to destroy, alter, duplicate, or obtain unauthorized possession of records, data, materials, equipment, or animals;\n\n\n(5) by theft or deception knowingly to obtain control or to exert control over records, data, material, equipment, or animals of any animal facility for the purpose of depriving the rightful owner or animal facility of the records, material, data, equipment, or animals or for the purpose of concealing, abandoning, or destroying these records, material, data, equipment, or animals; or\n\n\n(6) to enter or remain on an animal facility with the intent to commit an act prohibited under this Section.\n\n\n(d) Sentence.\n\n\n(1) Any person who violates any provision of subsection (c) shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony for each violation, unless the loss, theft, or damage to the animal facility property exceeds $300 in value.\n\n\n(2) If the loss, theft, or damage to the animal facility property exceeds $300 in value but does not exceed $10,000 in value, the person is guilty of a Class 3 felony.\n\n\n(3) If the loss, theft, or damage to the animal facility property exceeds $10,000 in value but does not exceed $100,000 in value, the person is guilty of a Class 2 felony.\n\n\n(4) If the loss, theft, or damage to the animal facility property exceeds $100,000 in value, the person is guilty of a Class 1 felony.\n\n\n(5) Any person who, with the intent that any violation of any provision of subsection (c) be committed, agrees with another to the commission of the violation and commits an act in furtherance of this agreement is guilty of the same class of felony as provided in paragraphs (1) through (4) of this subsection for that violation.\n\n\n(6) Restitution.\n\n\n(A) The court shall conduct a hearing to determine the reasonable cost of replacing materials, data, equipment, animals and records that may have been damaged, destroyed, lost or cannot be returned, and the reasonable cost of repeating any experimentation that may have been interrupted or invalidated as a result of a violation of subsection (c).\n\n\n(B) Any persons convicted of a violation shall be ordered jointly and severally to make restitution to the owner, operator, or both, of the animal facility in the full amount of the reasonable cost determined under paragraph (A).\n\n\n(e) Private right of action. Nothing in this Section shall preclude any animal facility injured in its business or property by a violation of this Section from seeking appropriate relief under any other provision of law or remedy including the issuance of a permanent injunction against any person who violates any provision of this Section. The animal facility owner or operator may petition the court to permanently enjoin the person from violating this Section and the court shall provide this relief.\n\n\n(f) The Director shall have authority to investigate any alleged violation of this Section, along with any other law enforcement agency, and may take any action within the Director’s authority necessary for the enforcement of this Section. State’s Attorneys, State police and other law enforcement officials shall provide any assistance required in the conduct of an investigation and prosecution. Before the Director reports a violation for prosecution he or she may give the owner or operator of the animal facility and the alleged violator an opportunity to present his or her views at an administrative hearing. The Director may adopt any rules and regulations necessary for the enforcement of this Section.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 97-1108, eff. 1-1-13.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/48-3)"

Stolen, converted, recovered and unclaimed vehicles.\n\n(a) Every Sheriff, Superintendent of police, Chief of police or other police officer in command of any Police department in any City, Village or Town of the State, shall, by the fastest means of communications available to his law enforcement agency, immediately report to the Illinois State Police, in Springfield, Illinois, the theft or recovery of any stolen or converted vehicle within his district or jurisdiction. The report shall give the date of theft, description of the vehicle including color, year of manufacture, manufacturer’s trade name, manufacturer’s series name, body style, vehicle identification number and license registration number, including the state in which the license was issued and the year of issuance, together with the name, residence address, business address, and telephone number of the owner. The report shall be routed by the originating law enforcement agency through the Illinois State Police District in which such agency is located.\n\n\n(b) A registered owner or a lienholder may report the theft by conversion of a vehicle, to the Illinois State Police, or any other police department or Sheriff’s office. Such report will be accepted as a report of theft and processed only if a formal complaint is on file and a warrant issued.\n\n\n(c) An operator of a place of business for garaging, repairing, parking or storing vehicles for the public, in which a vehicle remains unclaimed, after being left for the purpose of garaging, repairing, parking or storage, for a period of 15 days, shall, within 5 days after the expiration of that period, report the vehicle as unclaimed to the municipal police when the vehicle is within the corporate limits of any City, Village or incorporated Town, or the County Sheriff, or State Police when the vehicle is outside the corporate limits of a City, Village or incorporated Town. This Section does not apply to any vehicle:\n\n\n(1) removed to a place of storage by a law enforcement agency having jurisdiction, in accordance with Sections 4-201 and 4-203 of this Act; or\n\n\n(2) left under a garaging, repairing, parking, or storage order signed by the owner, lessor, or other legally entitled person.\n\n\nFailure to comply with this Section will result in the forfeiture of storage fees for that vehicle involved. (d) The Illinois State Police shall keep a complete record of all reports filed under this Section of the Act. Upon receipt of such report, a careful search shall be made of the records of the office of the Illinois State Police, and where it is found that a vehicle reported recovered was stolen in a County, City, Village or Town other than the County, City, Village or Town in which it is recovered, the Illinois State Police shall immediately notify the Sheriff, Superintendent of police, Chief of police, or other police officer in command of the Sheriff’s office or Police department of the County, City, Village or Town in which the vehicle was originally reported stolen, giving complete data as to the time and place of recovery.\n\n\n(e) Notification of the theft or conversion of a vehicle will be furnished to the Secretary of State by the Illinois State Police. The Secretary of State shall place the proper information in the license registration and title registration files to indicate the theft or conversion of a motor vehicle or other vehicle. Notification of the recovery of a vehicle previously reported as a theft or a conversion will be furnished to the Secretary of State by the Illinois State Police. The Secretary of State shall remove the proper information from the license registration and title registration files that has previously indicated the theft or conversion of a vehicle. The Secretary of State shall suspend the registration of a vehicle upon receipt of a report from the Illinois State Police that such vehicle was stolen or converted.\n\n\n(f) When the Secretary of State receives an application for a certificate of title or an application for registration of a vehicle and it is determined from the records of the office of the Secretary of State that such vehicle has been reported stolen or converted, the Secretary of State shall immediately notify the Illinois State Police or the Secretary of State Department of Police and shall give the Illinois State Police or the Secretary of State Department of Police the name and address of the person or firm titling or registering the vehicle, together with all other information contained in the application submitted by such person or firm. If the Secretary of State Department of Police receives notification under this subsection (f), it shall conduct an investigation concerning the identity of the registered owner of the stolen or converted vehicle.\n\n\n(g) During the usual course of business the manufacturer of any vehicle shall place an original manufacturer’s vehicle identification number on all such vehicles manufactured and on any part of such vehicles requiring an identification number.\n\n\n(h) Except provided in subsection (h-1), if a manufacturer’s vehicle identification number is missing or has been removed, changed or mutilated on any vehicle, or any part of such vehicle requiring an identification number, the Illinois State Police or the Secretary of State Department of Police shall restore, restamp or reaffix the vehicle identification number plate, or affix a new plate bearing the original manufacturer’s vehicle identification number on each such vehicle and on all necessary parts of the vehicles. A vehicle identification number so affixed, restored, restamped, reaffixed or replaced is not falsified, altered or forged within the meaning of this Act.\n\n\n(h-1) A person engaged in the repair or servicing of vehicles may reaffix a manufacturer’s identification number plate on the same damaged vehicle from which it was originally removed, if the person reaffixes the original manufacturer’s identification number plate in place of the identification number plate affixed on a new dashboard that has been installed in the vehicle. The person must notify the Secretary of State each time the original manufacturer’s identification number plate is reaffixed on a vehicle. The person must keep a record indicating that the identification number plate affixed on the new dashboard has been removed and has been replaced by the manufacturer’s identification number plate originally affixed on the vehicle. The person also must keep a record regarding the status and location of the identification number plate removed from the replacement dashboard. The Secretary shall adopt rules for implementing this subsection (h-1).\n\n\n(h-2) The owner of a vehicle repaired under subsection (h-1) must, within 90 days of the date of the repairs, contact an officer of the Illinois State Police Vehicle Inspection Bureau and arrange for an inspection of the vehicle, by the officer or the officer’s designee, at a mutually agreed upon date and location.\n\n\n(i) If a vehicle or part of any vehicle is found to have the manufacturer’s identification number removed, altered, defaced or destroyed, the vehicle or part shall be seized by any law enforcement agency having jurisdiction and held for the purpose of identification. In the event that the manufacturer’s identification number of a vehicle or part cannot be identified, the vehicle or part shall be considered contraband, and no right of property shall exist in any person owning, leasing or possessing such property, unless the person owning, leasing or possessing the vehicle or part acquired such without knowledge that the manufacturer’s vehicle identification number has been removed, altered, defaced, falsified or destroyed.\n\n\nEither the seizing law enforcement agency or the State’s Attorney of the county where the seizure occurred may make an application for an order of forfeiture to the circuit court in the county of seizure. The application for forfeiture shall be independent from any prosecution arising out of the seizure and is not subject to any final determination of such prosecution. The circuit court shall issue an order forfeiting the property to the seizing law enforcement agency if the court finds that the property did not at the time of seizure possess a valid manufacturer’s identification number and that the original manufacturer’s identification number cannot be ascertained. The seizing law enforcement agency may:\n\n\n(1) retain the forfeited property for official use; or\n\n\n(2) sell the forfeited property and distribute the proceeds in accordance with Section 4-211 of this Code, or dispose of the forfeited property in such manner as the law enforcement agency deems appropriate.\n\n\n(i-1) If a motorcycle is seized under subsection (i), the motorcycle must be returned within 45 days of the date of seizure to the person from whom it was seized, unless (i) criminal charges are pending against that person or (ii) an application for an order of forfeiture has been submitted to the circuit in the county of seizure or (iii) the circuit court in the county of seizure has received from the seizing law enforcement agency and has granted a petition to extend, for a single 30 day period, the 45 days allowed for return of the motorcycle. Except as provided in subsection (i-2), a motorcycle returned to the person from whom it was seized must be returned in essentially the same condition it was in at the time of seizure.\n\n\n(i-2) If any part or parts of a motorcycle seized under subsection (i) are found to be stolen and are removed, the seizing law enforcement agency is not required to replace the part or parts before returning the motorcycle to the person from whom it was seized.\n\n\n(j) The Illinois State Police or the Secretary of State Department of Police shall notify the Secretary of State each time a manufacturer’s vehicle identification number is affixed, reaffixed, restored or restamped on any vehicle. The Secretary of State shall make the necessary changes or corrections in his records, after the proper applications and fees have been submitted, if applicable.\n\n\n(k) Any vessel, vehicle or aircraft used with knowledge and consent of the owner in the commission of, or in the attempt to commit as defined in Section 8-4 of the Criminal Code of 2012, an offense prohibited by Section 4-103 of this Chapter, including transporting of a stolen vehicle or stolen vehicle parts, shall be seized by any law enforcement agency. The seizing law enforcement agency may:\n\n\n(1) return the vehicle to its owner if such vehicle is stolen; or\n\n\n(2) confiscate the vehicle and retain it for any purpose which the law enforcement agency deems appropriate; or\n\n\n(3) sell the vehicle at a public sale or dispose of the vehicle in such other manner as the law enforcement agency deems appropriate.\n\n\nIf the vehicle is sold at public sale, the proceeds of the sale shall be paid to the law enforcement agency. The law enforcement agency shall not retain, sell or dispose of a vehicle under paragraphs (2) or (3) of this subsection (k) except upon an order of forfeiture issued by the circuit court. The circuit court may issue such order of forfeiture upon application of the law enforcement agency or State’s Attorney of the county where the law enforcement agency has jurisdiction, or in the case of the Illinois State Police or the Secretary of State, upon application of the Attorney General.\n\n\nThe court shall issue the order if the owner of the vehicle has been convicted of transporting stolen vehicles or stolen vehicle parts and the evidence establishes that the owner’s vehicle has been used in the commission of such offense.\n\n\nThe provisions of subsection (k) of this Section shall not apply to any vessel, vehicle or aircraft, which has been leased, rented or loaned by its owner, if the owner did not have knowledge of and consent to the use of the vessel, vehicle or aircraft in the commission of, or in an attempt to commit, an offense prohibited by Section 4-103 of this Chapter.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21.)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/4-108) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 4-108)"

    "text": "Sec. 6-305. Renting motor vehicle to another.\n\n(a) No person shall rent a motor vehicle to any other person unless the latter person, or a driver designated by a nondriver with disabilities and meeting any minimum age and driver’s record requirements that are uniformly applied by the person renting a motor vehicle, is then duly licensed hereunder or, in the case of a nonresident, then duly licensed under the laws of the State or country of his residence unless the State or country of his residence does not require that a driver be licensed.\n\n\n(b) No person shall rent a motor vehicle to another until he has inspected, including through electronic or digital means, the driver’s license of the person to whom the vehicle is to be rented, or by whom it is to be driven, and verified the license is unexpired unless, in the case of a nonresident, the State or country wherein the nonresident resides does not require that a driver be licensed.\n\n\n(c) No person shall rent a motorcycle to another unless the latter person is then duly licensed hereunder as a motorcycle operator, and in the case of a nonresident, then duly licensed under the laws of the State or country of his residence, unless the State or country of his residence does not require that a driver be licensed.\n\n\n(c-1) A rental car company that rents a motor vehicle shall ensure that the renter is provided with an emergency telephone number to personnel capable of fielding roadside assistance and other customer service inquiries, including the ability to provide the caller with the telephone number of the location from which the vehicle was rented, if requested by the caller.

The person must provide, on the request of the renter, based on the available information, an estimated total of the daily rental rate, including all applicable taxes, fees, and other charges, or an estimated total rental charge, based on the return date of the vehicle noted on the rental agreement. Further, if the rental agreement does not already provide an estimated total rental charge, the following statement must be included in the rental agreement:\n\n\n“NOTICE: UNDER ILLINOIS LAW, YOU MAY REQUEST, BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION, AN ESTIMATED TOTAL DAILY RENTAL RATE, INCLUDING TAXES, FEES, AND OTHER CHARGES, OR AN ESTIMATED TOTAL RENTAL CHARGE, BASED ON THE VEHICLE RETURN DATE NOTED ON THIS AGREEMENT.”\n\n\nSuch person shall not charge in addition to the rental rate, taxes, mileage charge, and airport concession charge, if any, any fee which must be paid by the renter as a condition of hiring or leasing the vehicle, such as, but not limited to, required fuel or airport surcharges, nor any fee for transporting the renter to the location where the rented vehicle will be delivered to the renter. In addition to the rental rate, taxes, mileage charge, and airport concession charge, if any, such person may charge for an item or service provided in connection with a particular rental transaction if the renter can avoid incurring the charge by choosing not to obtain or utilize the optional item or service. Items and services for which such person may impose an additional charge include, but are not limited to, optional insurance and accessories requested by the renter, service charges incident to the renter’s optional return of the vehicle to a location other than the location where the vehicle was hired or leased, and charges for refueling the vehicle at the conclusion of the rental transaction in the event the renter did not return the vehicle with as much fuel as was in the fuel tank at the beginning of the rental. “Airport concession charge” means a charge or fee imposed and collected from a renter to reimburse the motor vehicle rental company for the concession fee it is required to pay to a local government corporate authority or airport authority to rent motor vehicles at the airport facility.

Such record may be maintained in an electronic or digital format, and shall be open to inspection by any police officer or designated agent of the Secretary of State. (h) A person licensed as a new car dealer under Section 5-101 of this Code shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section regarding the rental of private passenger motor vehicles when providing, free of charge, temporary substitute vehicles for customers to operate during a period when a customer’s vehicle, which is either leased or owned by that customer, is being repaired, serviced, replaced or otherwise made unavailable to the customer in accordance with an agreement with the licensed new car dealer or vehicle manufacturer, so long as the customer orally or in writing is made aware that the temporary substitute vehicle will be covered by his or her insurance policy and the customer shall only be liable to the extent of any amount deductible from such insurance coverage in accordance with the terms of the policy.\n\n\n(i) This Section, except the requirements of subsection (g), also applies to rental agreements of 30 continuous days or less involving a motor vehicle that was delivered by an out of State person or business to a renter in this State.\n\n\n(j) A public airport may, if approved by its local government corporate authorities or its airport authority, impose a customer facility charge upon customers of rental car companies for the purposes of financing, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining consolidated car rental facilities and common use transportation equipment and facilities, which are used to transport the customer, connecting consolidated car rental facilities with other airport facilities.\n\n\nNotwithstanding subsection (f) of this Section, the customer facility charge shall be collected by the rental car company as a separate charge, and clearly indicated as a separate charge on the rental agreement and invoice.

The total liability of a renter under subsection (a) for damage to a motor vehicle with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $50,000 or less may not exceed all of the following:\n\n\n(1) The lesser of:\n\n\n(A) Actual and reasonable costs that the person who rents a motor vehicle to another incurred to repair the motor vehicle or that the rental company would have incurred if the motor vehicle had been repaired, which shall reflect any discounts, price reductions, or adjustments available to the rental company; or\n\n\n(B) The fair market value of that motor vehicle immediately before the damage occurred, as determined in the customary market for the retail sale of that motor vehicle; and\n\n\n(2) Actual and reasonable costs incurred by the loss due to theft of the rental motor vehicle up to $2,000; provided, however, that if it is established that the renter or an authorized driver failed to exercise ordinary care while in possession of the vehicle or that the renter or an authorized driver committed or aided and abetted the commission of the theft, then the damages shall be the actual and reasonable costs of the rental vehicle up to its fair market value, as determined by the customary market for the sale of that vehicle.\n\n\nFor purposes of this subsection (b), for the period prior to June 1, 1998, the maximum amount that may be recovered from an authorized driver shall not exceed $6,000; for the period beginning June 1, 1998 through May 31, 1999, the maximum recovery shall not exceed $7,500; and for the period beginning June 1, 1999 through May 31, 2000, the maximum recovery shall not exceed $9,000.

A claim against a renter resulting from damage or loss to a rental vehicle must be reasonably and rationally related to the actual loss incurred. A rental company shall mitigate damages where possible and shall not assert or collect any claim for physical damage which exceeds the actual costs of the repair, including all discounts or price reductions.\n\n\n(f) No rental company shall require a deposit or an advance charge against the credit card of a renter, in any form, for damages to a vehicle which is in the renter’s possession, custody, or control. No rental company shall require any payment for damage to the rental vehicle, upon the renter’s return of the vehicle in a damaged condition, until after the cost of the damage to the vehicle and liability therefor is agreed to between the rental company and renter or is determined pursuant to law.\n\n\n(g) If insurance coverage exists under the renter’s personal insurance policy and the coverage is confirmed during regular business hours, the renter may require that the rental company must submit any claims to the renter’s personal insurance carrier as the renter’s agent. The rental company shall not make any written or oral representations that it will not present claims or negotiate with the renter’s insurance carrier. For purposes of this Section, confirmation of coverage includes telephone confirmation from insurance company representatives during regular business hours. After confirmation of coverage, the amount of claim shall be resolved between the insurance carrier and the rental company.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 99-201, eff. 10-1-15 .)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/6-305.3)"

The administrative system shall have as its purpose the fair and efficient enforcement of municipal or county regulations through the administrative adjudication of automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations and violations of municipal or county ordinances regulating the standing and parking of vehicles, the condition and use of vehicle equipment, and the display of municipal or county wheel tax licenses within the municipality’s or county’s borders. The administrative system shall only have authority to adjudicate civil offenses carrying fines not in excess of $500 or requiring the completion of a traffic education program, or both, that occur after the effective date of the ordinance adopting such a system under this Section. For purposes of this Section, “compliance violation” means a violation of a municipal or county regulation governing the condition or use of equipment on a vehicle or governing the display of a municipal or county wheel tax license.\n\n\n(b) Any ordinance establishing a system of administrative adjudication under this Section shall provide for:\n\n\n(1) A traffic compliance administrator authorized to adopt, distribute, and process parking, compliance, and automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violation notices and other notices required by this Section, collect money paid as fines and penalties for violation of parking and compliance ordinances and automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations, and operate an administrative adjudication system.\n\n\n(2) A parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice that shall specify or include the date, time, and place of violation of a parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulation; the particular regulation violated; any requirement to complete a traffic education program; the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late payment or failure to complete a required traffic education program, or both, when so provided by ordinance; the vehicle make or a photograph of the vehicle; the state registration number of the vehicle; and the identification number of the person issuing the notice. With regard to automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations, vehicle make shall be specified on the automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violation notice if the notice does not include a photograph of the vehicle and the make is available and readily discernible. With regard to municipalities or counties with a population of 1 million or more, it shall be grounds for dismissal of a parking violation if the state registration number or vehicle make specified is incorrect. The violation notice shall state that the completion of any required traffic education program, the payment of any indicated fine, and the payment of any applicable penalty for late payment or failure to complete a required traffic education program, or both, shall operate as a final disposition of the violation. The notice also shall contain information as to the availability of a hearing in which the violation may be contested on its merits. The violation notice shall specify the time and manner in which a hearing may be had.\n\n\n(3) Service of a parking, standing, or compliance violation notice by: (i) affixing the original or a facsimile of the notice to an unlawfully parked or standing vehicle; (ii) handing the notice to the operator of a vehicle if he or she is present; or (iii) mailing the notice to the address of the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle within 30 days after the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner or lessee of the vehicle, but not later than 90 days after the date of the violation, except that in the case of a lessee of a motor vehicle, service of a parking, standing, or compliance violation notice may occur no later than 210 days after the violation; and service of an automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violation notice by mail to the address of the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle within 30 days after the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner or lessee of the vehicle, but not later than 90 days after the violation, except that in the case of a lessee of a motor vehicle, service of an automated traffic law violation notice may occur no later than 210 days after the violation. A person authorized by ordinance to issue and serve parking, standing, and compliance violation notices shall certify as to the correctness of the facts entered on the violation notice by signing his or her name to the notice at the time of service or, in the case of a notice produced by a computerized device, by signing a single certificate to be kept by the traffic compliance administrator attesting to the correctness of all notices produced by the device while it was under his or her control. In the case of an automated traffic law violation, the ordinance shall require a determination by a technician employed or contracted by the municipality or county that, based on inspection of recorded images, the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance. If the technician determines that the vehicle entered the intersection as part of a funeral procession or in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle, a citation shall not be issued. In municipalities with a population of less than 1,000,000 inhabitants and counties with a population of less than 3,000,000 inhabitants, the automated traffic law ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance must be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality or county issuing the violation.

In the case of an automated speed enforcement system violation, the ordinance shall require a determination by a technician employed by the municipality, based upon an inspection of recorded images, video or other documentation, including documentation of the speed limit and automated speed enforcement signage, and documentation of the inspection, calibration, and certification of the speed equipment, that the vehicle was being operated in violation of Article VI of Chapter 11 of this Code or a similar local ordinance. If the technician determines that the vehicle speed was not determined by a calibrated, certified speed equipment device based upon the speed equipment documentation, or if the vehicle was an emergency vehicle, a citation may not be issued. The automated speed enforcement ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a violation occurred be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality issuing the violation or by an additional fully trained reviewing technician who is not employed by the contractor who employs the technician who made the initial determination. Routine and independent calibration of the speeds produced by automated speed enforcement systems and equipment shall be conducted annually by a qualified technician. Speeds produced by an automated speed enforcement system shall be compared with speeds produced by lidar or other independent equipment. Radar or lidar equipment shall undergo an internal validation test no less frequently than once each week. Qualified technicians shall test loop-based equipment no less frequently than once a year. Radar equipment shall be checked for accuracy by a qualified technician when the unit is serviced, when unusual or suspect readings persist, or when deemed necessary by a reviewing technician. Radar equipment shall be checked with the internal frequency generator and the internal circuit test whenever the radar is turned on. Technicians must be alert for any unusual or suspect readings, and if unusual or suspect readings of a radar unit persist, that unit shall immediately be removed from service and not returned to service until it has been checked by a qualified technician and determined to be functioning properly. Documentation of the annual calibration results, including the equipment tested, test date, technician performing the test, and test results, shall be maintained and available for use in the determination of an automated speed enforcement system violation and issuance of a citation. The technician performing the calibration and testing of the automated speed enforcement equipment shall be trained and certified in the use of equipment for speed enforcement purposes. Training on the speed enforcement equipment may be conducted by law enforcement, civilian, or manufacturer’s personnel and if applicable may be equivalent to the equipment use and operations training included in the Speed Measuring Device Operator Program developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The vendor or technician who performs the work shall keep accurate records on each piece of equipment the technician calibrates and tests. As used in this paragraph, “fully trained reviewing technician” means a person who has received at least 40 hours of supervised training in subjects which shall include image inspection and interpretation, the elements necessary to prove a violation, license plate identification, and traffic safety and management. In all municipalities and counties, the automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law ordinance shall require that no additional fee shall be charged to the alleged violator for exercising his or her right to an administrative hearing, and persons shall be given at least 25 days following an administrative hearing to pay any civil penalty imposed by a finding that Section 11-208.6, 11-208.8, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a similar local ordinance has been violated. The original or a facsimile of the violation notice or, in the case of a notice produced by a computerized device, a printed record generated by the device showing the facts entered on the notice, shall be retained by the traffic compliance administrator, and shall be a record kept in the ordinary course of business. A parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice issued, signed, and served in accordance with this Section, a copy of the notice, or the computer-generated record shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts shown on the notice. The notice, copy, or computer-generated record shall be admissible in any subsequent administrative or legal proceedings.\n\n\n(4) An opportunity for a hearing for the registered owner of the vehicle cited in the parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice in which the owner may contest the merits of the alleged violation, and during which formal or technical rules of evidence shall not apply; provided, however, that under Section 11-1306 of this Code the lessee of a vehicle cited in the violation notice likewise shall be provided an opportunity for a hearing of the same kind afforded the registered owner. The hearings shall be recorded, and the person conducting the hearing on behalf of the traffic compliance administrator shall be empowered to administer oaths and to secure by subpoena both the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant books and papers. Persons appearing at a hearing under this Section may be represented by counsel at their expense. The ordinance may also provide for internal administrative review following the decision of the hearing officer.\n\n\n(5) Service of additional notices, sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the registered owner of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary of State or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database, or, under Section 11-1306 or subsection (p) of Section 11-208.6 or 11-208.9, or subsection (p) of Section 11-208.8 of this Code, to the lessee of the cited vehicle at the last address known to the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database. The service shall be deemed complete as of the date of deposit in the United States mail. The notices shall be in the following sequence and shall include, but not be limited to, the information specified herein:\n\n\n(i) A second notice of parking, standing, or compliance violation if the first notice of the violation was issued by affixing the original or a facsimile of the notice to the unlawfully parked vehicle or by handing the notice to the operator. This notice shall specify or include the date and location of the violation cited in the parking, standing, or compliance violation notice, the particular regulation violated, the vehicle make or a photograph of the vehicle, the state registration number of the vehicle, any requirement to complete a traffic education program, the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late payment or failure to complete a traffic education program, or both, when so provided by ordinance, the availability of a hearing in which the violation may be contested on its merits, and the time and manner in which the hearing may be had. The notice of violation shall also state that failure to complete a required traffic education program, to pay the indicated fine and any applicable penalty, or to appear at a hearing on the merits in the time and manner specified, will result in a final determination of violation liability for the cited violation in the amount of the fine or penalty indicated, and that, upon the occurrence of a final determination of violation liability for the failure, and the exhaustion of, or failure to exhaust, available administrative or judicial procedures for review, any incomplete traffic education program or any unpaid fine or penalty, or both, will constitute a debt due and owing the municipality or county.\n\n\n(ii) A notice of final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability. This notice shall be sent following a final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability and the conclusion of judicial review procedures taken under this Section. The notice shall state that the incomplete traffic education program or the unpaid fine or penalty, or both, is a debt due and owing the municipality or county. The notice shall contain warnings that failure to complete any required traffic education program or to pay any fine or penalty due and owing the municipality or county, or both, within the time specified may result in the municipality’s or county’s filing of a petition in the Circuit Court to have the incomplete traffic education program or unpaid fine or penalty, or both, rendered a judgment as provided by this Section, or, where applicable, may result in suspension of the person’s driver’s license for failure to complete a traffic education program.\n\n\n(6) A notice of impending driver’s license suspension. This notice shall be sent to the person liable for failure to complete a required traffic education program. The notice shall state that failure to complete a required traffic education program within 45 days of the notice’s date will result in the municipality or county notifying the Secretary of State that the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings under Section 6-306.5 of this Code. The notice shall also state that the person may obtain a photostatic copy of an original ticket imposing a fine or penalty by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the municipality or county along with a request for the photostatic copy. The notice of impending driver’s license suspension shall be sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address recorded with the Secretary of State or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database.\n\n\n(7) Final determinations of violation liability. A final determination of violation liability shall occur following failure to complete the required traffic education program or to pay the fine or penalty, or both, after a hearing officer’s determination of violation liability and the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust any administrative review procedures provided by ordinance. Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed notice, the hearing officer’s determination of violation liability shall become final: (A) upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination, or (B) upon expiration of the period for filing the petition without a filing having been made.\n\n\n(8) A petition to set aside a determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability that may be filed by a person owing an unpaid fine or penalty. A petition to set aside a determination of liability may also be filed by a person required to complete a traffic education program. The petition shall be filed with and ruled upon by the traffic compliance administrator in the manner and within the time specified by ordinance. The grounds for the petition may be limited to: (A) the person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued, (B) the person having already completed the required traffic education program or paid the fine or penalty, or both, for the violation in question, and (C) excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. With regard to municipalities or counties with a population of 1 million or more, it shall be grounds for dismissal of a parking violation if the state registration number or vehicle make, only if specified in the violation notice, is incorrect. After the determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability has been set aside upon a showing of just cause, the registered owner shall be provided with a hearing on the merits for that violation.\n\n\n(9) Procedures for non-residents. Procedures by which persons who are not residents of the municipality or county may contest the merits of the alleged violation without attending a hearing.\n\n\n(10) A schedule of civil fines for violations of vehicular standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulations enacted by ordinance pursuant to this Section, and a schedule of penalties for late payment of the fines or failure to complete required traffic education programs, provided, however, that the total amount of the fine and penalty for any one violation shall not exceed $250, except as provided in subsection (c) of Section 11-1301.3 of this Code.\n\n\n(11) Other provisions as are necessary and proper to carry into effect the powers granted and purposes stated in this Section.\n\n\n(c) Any municipality or county establishing vehicular standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulations under this Section may also provide by ordinance for a program of vehicle immobilization for the purpose of facilitating enforcement of those regulations. The program of vehicle immobilization shall provide for immobilizing any eligible vehicle upon the public way by presence of a restraint in a manner to prevent operation of the vehicle. Any ordinance establishing a program of vehicle immobilization under this Section shall provide: (1) Criteria for the designation of vehicles eligible for immobilization. A vehicle shall be eligible for immobilization when the registered owner of the vehicle has accumulated the number of incomplete traffic education programs or unpaid final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability, or both, as determined by ordinance.\n\n\n(2) A notice of impending vehicle immobilization and a right to a hearing to challenge the validity of the notice by disproving liability for the incomplete traffic education programs or unpaid final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability, or both, listed on the notice.\n\n\n(3) The right to a prompt hearing after a vehicle has been immobilized or subsequently towed without the completion of the required traffic education program or payment of the outstanding fines and penalties on parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations, or both, for which final determinations have been issued. An order issued after the hearing is a final administrative decision within the meaning of Section 3-101 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n(4) A post immobilization and post-towing notice advising the registered owner of the vehicle of the right to a hearing to challenge the validity of the impoundment.\n\n\n(d) Judicial review of final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations and final administrative decisions issued after hearings regarding vehicle immobilization and impoundment made under this Section shall be subject to the provisions of the Administrative Review Law. (e) Any fine, penalty, incomplete traffic education program, or part of any fine or any penalty remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, administrative remedies created under this Section and the conclusion of any judicial review procedures shall be a debt due and owing the municipality or county and, as such, may be collected in accordance with applicable law. Completion of any required traffic education program and payment in full of any fine or penalty resulting from a standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation shall constitute a final disposition of that violation.\n\n\n(f) After the expiration of the period within which judicial review may be sought for a final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation, the municipality or county may commence a proceeding in the Circuit Court for purposes of obtaining a judgment on the final determination of violation. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a municipality or county from consolidating multiple final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations against a person in a proceeding. Upon commencement of the action, the municipality or county shall file a certified copy or record of the final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation, which shall be accompanied by a certification that recites facts sufficient to show that the final determination of violation was issued in accordance with this Section and the applicable municipal or county ordinance. Service of the summons and a copy of the petition may be by any method provided by Section 2-203 of the Code of Civil Procedure or by certified mail, return receipt requested, provided that the total amount of fines and penalties for final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations does not exceed $2500. If the court is satisfied that the final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation was entered in accordance with the requirements of this Section and the applicable municipal or county ordinance, and that the registered owner or the lessee, as the case may be, had an opportunity for an administrative hearing and for judicial review as provided in this Section, the court shall render judgment in favor of the municipality or county and against the registered owner or the lessee for the amount indicated in the final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation, plus costs. The judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced in the same manner as other judgments for the recovery of money.\n\n\n(g) The fee for participating in a traffic education program under this Section shall not exceed $25.\n\n\nA low-income individual required to complete a traffic education program under this Section who provides proof of eligibility for the federal earned income tax credit under Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code or the Illinois earned income tax credit under Section 212 of the Illinois Income Tax Act shall not be required to pay any fee for participating in a required traffic education program.\n\n\n(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a person shall not be liable for violations, fees, fines, or penalties under this Section during the period in which the motor vehicle was stolen or hijacked, as indicated in a report to the appropriate law enforcement agency filed in a timely manner.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-32, eff. 6-28-19; 101-623, eff. 7-1-20; 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-905, eff. 1-1-23 .)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-208.4)"

    "text": "Sec. 11-208.6. Automated traffic law enforcement system.\n\n(a) As used in this Section, “automated traffic law enforcement system” means a device with one or more motor vehicle sensors working in conjunction with a red light signal to produce recorded images of motor vehicles entering an intersection against a red signal indication in violation of Section 11-306 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance.\n\n\nAn automated traffic law enforcement system is a system, in a municipality or county operated by a governmental agency, that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle’s violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance and is designed to obtain a clear recorded image of the vehicle and the vehicle’s license plate. The recorded image must also display the time, date, and location of the violation.\n\n\n(b) As used in this Section, “recorded images” means images recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system on:\n\n\n(1) 2 or more photographs;\n\n\n(2) 2 or more microphotographs;\n\n\n(3) 2 or more electronic images; or\n\n\n(4) a video recording showing the motor vehicle and, on at least one image or portion of the recording, clearly identifying the registration plate or digital registration plate number of the motor vehicle.\n\n\n(b-5) A municipality or county that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle’s violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance must make the recorded images of a violation accessible to the alleged violator by providing the alleged violator with a website address, accessible through the Internet. (c) Except as provided under Section 11-208.8 of this Code, a county or municipality, including a home rule county or municipality, may not use an automated traffic law enforcement system to provide recorded images of a motor vehicle for the purpose of recording its speed. Except as provided under Section 11-208.8 of this Code, the regulation of the use of automated traffic law enforcement systems to record vehicle speeds is an exclusive power and function of the State. This subsection (c) is a denial and limitation of home rule powers and functions under subsection (h) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution.\n\n\n(c-5) A county or municipality, including a home rule county or municipality, may not use an automated traffic law enforcement system to issue violations in instances where the motor vehicle comes to a complete stop and does not enter the intersection, as defined by Section 1-132 of this Code, during the cycle of the red signal indication unless one or more pedestrians or bicyclists are present, even if the motor vehicle stops at a point past a stop line or crosswalk where a driver is required to stop, as specified in subsection (c) of Section 11-306 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance.\n\n\n(c-6) A county, or a municipality with less than 2,000,000 inhabitants, including a home rule county or municipality, may not use an automated traffic law enforcement system to issue violations in instances where a motorcyclist enters an intersection against a red signal indication when the red signal fails to change to a green signal within a reasonable period of time not less than 120 seconds because of a signal malfunction or because the signal has failed to detect the arrival of the motorcycle due to the motorcycle’s size or weight.\n\n\n(d) For each violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance recorded by an automatic traffic law enforcement system, the county or municipality having jurisdiction shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered owner of the vehicle as the alleged violator. The notice shall be delivered to the registered owner of the vehicle, by mail, within 30 days after the Secretary of State notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner of the vehicle, but in no event later than 90 days after the violation.\n\n\nThe notice shall include:\n\n\n(1) the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle;\n\n\n(2) the registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the violation;\n\n\n(3) the violation charged; (4) the location where the violation occurred;\n\n\n(5) the date and time of the violation;\n\n\n(6) a copy of the recorded images;\n\n\n(7) the amount of the civil penalty imposed and the requirements of any traffic education program imposed and the date by which the civil penalty should be paid and the traffic education program should be completed;\n\n\n(8) a statement that recorded images are evidence of a violation of a red light signal;\n\n\n(9) a warning that failure to pay the civil penalty, to complete a required traffic education program, or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability;\n\n\n(10) a statement that the person may elect to proceed by:\n\n\n(A) paying the fine, completing a required traffic education program, or both; or\n\n\n(B) challenging the charge in court, by mail, or by administrative hearing; and\n\n\n(11) a website address, accessible through the Internet, where the person may view the recorded images of the violation.\n\n\n(e) (Blank).\n\n\n(f) Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated traffic law enforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be evidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation under this Section.\n\n\n(g) Recorded images made by an automatic traffic law enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation.\n\n\n(h) The court or hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation:\n\n\n(1) that the motor vehicle or registration plates or digital registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation;\n\n\n(2) that the driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection when the light was red either (i) in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or (ii) as part of a funeral procession; and\n\n\n(3) any other evidence or issues provided by municipal or county ordinance.\n\n\n(i) To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates or digital registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner. (j) Unless the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer at the time of the violation, the motor vehicle owner is subject to a civil penalty not exceeding $100 or the completion of a traffic education program, or both, plus an additional penalty of not more than $100 for failure to pay the original penalty or to complete a required traffic education program, or both, in a timely manner, if the motor vehicle is recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system. A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this Section is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of the vehicle.\n\n\n(j-3) A registered owner who is a holder of a valid commercial driver’s license is not required to complete a traffic education program.\n\n\n(j-5) For purposes of the required traffic education program only, a registered owner may submit an affidavit to the court or hearing officer swearing that at the time of the alleged violation, the vehicle was in the custody and control of another person. The affidavit must identify the person in custody and control of the vehicle, including the person’s name and current address. The person in custody and control of the vehicle at the time of the violation is required to complete the required traffic education program. If the person in custody and control of the vehicle at the time of the violation completes the required traffic education program, the registered owner of the vehicle is not required to complete a traffic education program.\n\n\n(k) An intersection equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must be posted with a sign visible to approaching traffic indicating that the intersection is being monitored by an automated traffic law enforcement system.\n\n\n(k-3) A municipality or county that has one or more intersections equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must provide notice to drivers by posting the locations of automated traffic law systems on the municipality or county website.\n\n\n(k-5) An intersection equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must have a yellow change interval that conforms with the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (IMUTCD) published by the Illinois Department of Transportation.\n\n\n(k-7) A municipality or county operating an automated traffic law enforcement system shall conduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact of each automated traffic law enforcement system at an intersection following installation of the system. The statistical analysis shall be based upon the best available crash, traffic, and other data, and shall cover a period of time before and after installation of the system sufficient to provide a statistically valid comparison of safety impact. The statistical analysis shall be consistent with professional judgment and acceptable industry practice. The statistical analysis also shall be consistent with the data required for valid comparisons of before and after conditions and shall be conducted within a reasonable period following the installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The statistical analysis required by this subsection (k-7) shall be made available to the public and shall be published on the website of the municipality or county. If the statistical analysis for the 36 month period following installation of the system indicates that there has been an increase in the rate of crashes at the approach to the intersection monitored by the system, the municipality or county shall undertake additional studies to determine the cause and severity of the crashes, and may take any action that it determines is necessary or appropriate to reduce the number or severity of the crashes at that intersection.\n\n\n(l) The compensation paid for an automated traffic law enforcement system must be based on the value of the equipment or the services provided and may not be based on the number of traffic citations issued or the revenue generated by the system.\n\n\n(m) This Section applies only to the counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, Madison, McHenry, St. Clair, and Will and to municipalities located within those counties.\n\n\n(n) The fee for participating in a traffic education program under this Section shall not exceed $25.\n\n\nA low-income individual required to complete a traffic education program under this Section who provides proof of eligibility for the federal earned income tax credit under Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code or the Illinois earned income tax credit under Section 212 of the Illinois Income Tax Act shall not be required to pay any fee for participating in a required traffic education program.\n\n\n(o) (Blank).\n\n\n(p) No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a written lease agreement shall be liable for an automated speed or traffic law enforcement system violation involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease; provided that upon the request of the appropriate authority received within 120 days after the violation occurred, the lessor provides within 60 days after such receipt the name and address of the lessee.\n\n\nUpon the provision of information by the lessor pursuant to this subsection, the county or municipality may issue the violation to the lessee of the vehicle in the same manner as it would issue a violation to a registered owner of a vehicle pursuant to this Section, and the lessee may be held liable for the violation.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-395, eff. 8-16-19; 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-982, eff. 7-1-23.)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-208.7)"

    "text": "Sec. 11-208.8. Automated speed enforcement systems in safety zones.\n\n(a) As used in this Section:\n\n\n“Automated speed enforcement system” means a photographic device, radar device, laser device, or other electrical or mechanical device or devices installed or utilized in a safety zone and designed to record the speed of a vehicle and obtain a clear photograph or other recorded image of the vehicle and the vehicle’s registration plate or digital registration plate while the driver is violating Article VI of Chapter 11 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance.\n\n\nAn automated speed enforcement system is a system, located in a safety zone which is under the jurisdiction of a municipality, that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle’s violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance and is designed to obtain a clear recorded image of the vehicle and the vehicle’s license plate. The recorded image must also display the time, date, and location of the violation.\n\n\n“Owner” means the person or entity to whom the vehicle is registered.\n\n\n“Recorded image” means images recorded by an automated speed enforcement system on:\n\n\n(1) 2 or more photographs;\n\n\n(2) 2 or more microphotographs;\n\n\n(3) 2 or more electronic images; or\n\n\n(4) a video recording showing the motor vehicle and, on at least one image or portion of the recording, clearly identifying the registration plate or digital registration plate number of the motor vehicle.\n\n\n“Safety zone” means an area that is within one-eighth of a mile from the nearest property line of any public or private elementary or secondary school, or from the nearest property line of any facility, area, or land owned by a school district that is used for educational purposes approved by the Illinois State Board of Education, not including school district headquarters or administrative buildings. A safety zone also includes an area that is within one-eighth of a mile from the nearest property line of any facility, area, or land owned by a park district used for recreational purposes. However, if any portion of a roadway is within either one-eighth mile radius, the safety zone also shall include the roadway extended to the furthest portion of the next furthest intersection. The term “safety zone” does not include any portion of the roadway known as Lake Shore Drive or any controlled access highway with 8 or more lanes of traffic. (a-5) The automated speed enforcement system shall be operational and violations shall be recorded only at the following times:\n\n\n(i) if the safety zone is based upon the property line of any facility, area, or land owned by a school district, only on school days and no earlier than 6 a.m. and no later than 8:30 p.m. if the school day is during the period of Monday through Thursday, or 9 p.m. if the school day is a Friday; and\n\n\n(ii) if the safety zone is based upon the property line of any facility, area, or land owned by a park district, no earlier than one hour prior to the time that the facility, area, or land is open to the public or other patrons, and no later than one hour after the facility, area, or land is closed to the public or other patrons.\n\n\n(b) A municipality that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle’s violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance must make the recorded images of a violation accessible to the alleged violator by providing the alleged violator with a website address, accessible through the Internet. (c) Notwithstanding any penalties for any other violations of this Code, the owner of a motor vehicle used in a traffic violation recorded by an automated speed enforcement system shall be subject to the following penalties:\n\n\n(1) if the recorded speed is no less than 6 miles per hour and no more than 10 miles per hour over the legal speed limit, a civil penalty not exceeding $50, plus an additional penalty of not more than $50 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely manner; or\n\n\n(2) if the recorded speed is more than 10 miles per hour over the legal speed limit, a civil penalty not exceeding $100, plus an additional penalty of not more than $100 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely manner.\n\n\nA penalty may not be imposed under this Section if the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer for a speeding violation occurring within one-eighth of a mile and 15 minutes of the violation that was recorded by the system. A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this Section is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of the vehicle. A law enforcement officer is not required to be present or to witness the violation. No penalty may be imposed under this Section if the recorded speed of a vehicle is 5 miles per hour or less over the legal speed limit. The municipality may send, in the same manner that notices are sent under this Section, a speed violation warning notice where the violation involves a speed of 5 miles per hour or less above the legal speed limit. (d) The net proceeds that a municipality receives from civil penalties imposed under an automated speed enforcement system, after deducting all non-personnel and personnel costs associated with the operation and maintenance of such system, shall be expended or obligated by the municipality for the following purposes:\n\n\n(i) public safety initiatives to ensure safe passage around schools, and to provide police protection and surveillance around schools and parks, including but not limited to: (1) personnel costs; and (2) non-personnel costs such as construction and maintenance of public safety infrastructure and equipment;\n\n\n(ii) initiatives to improve pedestrian and traffic safety;\n\n\n(iii) construction and maintenance of infrastructure within the municipality, including but not limited to roads and bridges; and\n\n\n(iv) after school programs. (e) For each violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance recorded by an automated speed enforcement system, the municipality having jurisdiction shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered owner of the vehicle as the alleged violator. The notice shall be delivered to the registered owner of the vehicle, by mail, within 30 days after the Secretary of State notifies the municipality of the identity of the owner of the vehicle, but in no event later than 90 days after the violation.\n\n\n(f) The notice required under subsection (e) of this Section shall include:\n\n\n(1) the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle;\n\n\n(2) the registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the violation;\n\n\n(3) the violation charged; (4) the date, time, and location where the violation occurred;\n\n\n(5) a copy of the recorded image or images; (6) the amount of the civil penalty imposed and the date by which the civil penalty should be paid;\n\n\n(7) a statement that recorded images are evidence of a violation of a speed restriction;\n\n\n(8) a warning that failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability;\n\n\n(9) a statement that the person may elect to proceed by:\n\n\n(A) paying the fine; or (B) challenging the charge in court, by mail, or by administrative hearing; and\n\n\n(10) a website address, accessible through the Internet, where the person may view the recorded images of the violation.\n\n\n(g) (Blank).\n\n\n(h) Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated speed enforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be evidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation under this Section.\n\n\n(i) Recorded images made by an automated speed enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation.\n\n\n(j) The court or hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation:\n\n\n(1) that the motor vehicle or registration plates or digital registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control or in the possession of the owner or lessee at the time of the violation;\n\n\n(1.5) that the motor vehicle was hijacked before the violation occurred and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner or lessee at the time of the violation;\n\n\n(2) that the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer for a speeding violation occurring within one-eighth of a mile and 15 minutes of the violation that was recorded by the system; and\n\n\n(3) any other evidence or issues provided by municipal ordinance.\n\n\n(k) To demonstrate that the motor vehicle was hijacked or the motor vehicle or registration plates or digital registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner or lessee at the time of the violation, the owner or lessee must submit proof that a report concerning the motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner. (l) A roadway equipped with an automated speed enforcement system shall be posted with a sign conforming to the national Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices that is visible to approaching traffic stating that vehicle speeds are being photo-enforced and indicating the speed limit. The municipality shall install such additional signage as it determines is necessary to give reasonable notice to drivers as to where automated speed enforcement systems are installed.\n\n\n(m) A roadway where a new automated speed enforcement system is installed shall be posted with signs providing 30 days notice of the use of a new automated speed enforcement system prior to the issuance of any citations through the automated speed enforcement system.\n\n\n(n) The compensation paid for an automated speed enforcement system must be based on the value of the equipment or the services provided and may not be based on the number of traffic citations issued or the revenue generated by the system.\n\n\n(o) (Blank).\n\n\n(p) No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a written lease agreement shall be liable for an automated speed or traffic law enforcement system violation involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease; provided that upon the request of the appropriate authority received within 120 days after the violation occurred, the lessor provides within 60 days after such receipt the name and address of the lessee. The drivers license number of a lessee may be subsequently individually requested by the appropriate authority if needed for enforcement of this Section.\n\n\nUpon the provision of information by the lessor pursuant to this subsection, the municipality may issue the violation to the lessee of the vehicle in the same manner as it would issue a violation to a registered owner of a vehicle pursuant to this Section, and the lessee may be held liable for the violation.\n\n\n(q) A municipality using an automated speed enforcement system must provide notice to drivers by publishing the locations of all safety zones where system equipment is installed on the website of the municipality.\n\n\n(r) A municipality operating an automated speed enforcement system shall conduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact of the system. The statistical analysis shall be based upon the best available crash, traffic, and other data, and shall cover a period of time before and after installation of the system sufficient to provide a statistically valid comparison of safety impact. The statistical analysis shall be consistent with professional judgment and acceptable industry practice. The statistical analysis also shall be consistent with the data required for valid comparisons of before and after conditions and shall be conducted within a reasonable period following the installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The statistical analysis required by this subsection shall be made available to the public and shall be published on the website of the municipality.\n\n\n(s) This Section applies only to municipalities with a population of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-395, eff. 8-16-19; 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-905, eff. 1-1-23 .)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-208.9)\n\n(Text of Section from P.A. 102-982)"

Automated traffic law enforcement system; approaching, overtaking, and passing a school bus.\n\n(a) As used in this Section, “automated traffic law enforcement system” means a device with one or more motor vehicle sensors working in conjunction with the visual signals on a school bus, as specified in Sections 12-803 and 12-805 of this Code, to produce recorded images of motor vehicles that fail to stop before meeting or overtaking, from either direction, any school bus stopped at any location for the purpose of receiving or discharging pupils in violation of Section 11-1414 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance.\n\n\nAn automated traffic law enforcement system is a system, in a municipality or county operated by a governmental agency, that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle’s violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance and is designed to obtain a clear recorded image of the vehicle and the vehicle’s license plate. The recorded image must also display the time, date, and location of the violation.\n\n\n(b) As used in this Section, “recorded images” means images recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system on:\n\n\n(1) 2 or more photographs;\n\n\n(2) 2 or more microphotographs;\n\n\n(3) 2 or more electronic images; or\n\n\n(4) a video recording showing the motor vehicle and, on at least one image or portion of the recording, clearly identifying the registration plate or digital registration plate number of the motor vehicle.\n\n\n(c) A municipality or county that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle’s violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance must make the recorded images of a violation accessible to the alleged violator by providing the alleged violator with a website address, accessible through the Internet. (d) For each violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system, the county or municipality having jurisdiction shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered owner of the vehicle as the alleged violator. The notice shall be delivered to the registered owner of the vehicle, by mail, within 30 days after the Secretary of State notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner of the vehicle, but in no event later than 90 days after the violation.\n\n\n(e) The notice required under subsection (d) shall include:\n\n\n(1) the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle;\n\n\n(2) the registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the violation;\n\n\n(3) the violation charged; (4) the location where the violation occurred;\n\n\n(5) the date and time of the violation;\n\n\n(6) a copy of the recorded images;\n\n\n(7) the amount of the civil penalty imposed and the date by which the civil penalty should be paid;\n\n\n(8) a statement that recorded images are evidence of a violation of overtaking or passing a school bus stopped for the purpose of receiving or discharging pupils;\n\n\n(9) a warning that failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability;\n\n\n(10) a statement that the person may elect to proceed by:\n\n\n(A) paying the fine; or (B) challenging the charge in court, by mail, or by administrative hearing; and\n\n\n(11) a website address, accessible through the Internet, where the person may view the recorded images of the violation.\n\n\n(f) (Blank).\n\n\n(g) Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated traffic law enforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be evidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation under this Section.\n\n\n(h) Recorded images made by an automated traffic law enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation.\n\n\n(i) The court or hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation:\n\n\n(1) that the motor vehicle or registration plates or digital registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation;\n\n\n(2) that the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer for a violation of Section 11-1414 of this Code within one-eighth of a mile and 15 minutes of the violation that was recorded by the system;\n\n\n(3) that the visual signals required by Sections 12-803 and 12-805 of this Code were damaged, not activated, not present in violation of Sections 12-803 and 12-805, or inoperable; and\n\n\n(4) any other evidence or issues provided by municipal or county ordinance.\n\n\n(j) To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates or digital registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner. (k) Unless the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer at the time of the violation, the motor vehicle owner is subject to a civil penalty not exceeding $150 for a first time violation or $500 for a second or subsequent violation, plus an additional penalty of not more than $100 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely manner, if the motor vehicle is recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system. A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this Section is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of the vehicle, but may be recorded by the municipality or county for the purpose of determining if a person is subject to the higher fine for a second or subsequent offense.\n\n\n(l) A school bus equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must be posted with a sign indicating that the school bus is being monitored by an automated traffic law enforcement system.\n\n\n(m) A municipality or county that has one or more school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must provide notice to drivers by posting a list of school districts using school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system on the municipality or county website. School districts that have one or more school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must provide notice to drivers by posting that information on their websites.\n\n\n(n) A municipality or county operating an automated traffic law enforcement system shall conduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact in each school district using school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system following installation of the system. The statistical analysis shall be based upon the best available crash, traffic, and other data, and shall cover a period of time before and after installation of the system sufficient to provide a statistically valid comparison of safety impact. The statistical analysis shall be consistent with professional judgment and acceptable industry practice. The statistical analysis also shall be consistent with the data required for valid comparisons of before and after conditions and shall be conducted within a reasonable period following the installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The statistical analysis required by this subsection shall be made available to the public and shall be published on the website of the municipality or county. If the statistical analysis for the 36-month period following installation of the system indicates that there has been an increase in the rate of crashes at the approach to school buses monitored by the system, the municipality or county shall undertake additional studies to determine the cause and severity of the crashes, and may take any action that it determines is necessary or appropriate to reduce the number or severity of the crashes involving school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system.\n\n\n(o) The compensation paid for an automated traffic law enforcement system must be based on the value of the equipment or the services provided and may not be based on the number of traffic citations issued or the revenue generated by the system.\n\n\n(p) No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a written lease agreement shall be liable for an automated speed or traffic law enforcement system violation involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease; provided that upon the request of the appropriate authority received within 120 days after the violation occurred, the lessor provides within 60 days after such receipt the name and address of the lessee.\n\n\nUpon the provision of information by the lessor pursuant to this subsection, the county or municipality may issue the violation to the lessee of the vehicle in the same manner as it would issue a violation to a registered owner of a vehicle pursuant to this Section, and the lessee may be held liable for the violation.\n\n\n(q) (Blank).\n\n\n(r) After a municipality or county enacts an ordinance providing for automated traffic law enforcement systems under this Section, each school district within that municipality or county’s jurisdiction may implement an automated traffic law enforcement system under this Section.

A person’s refusal to sign the warning shall not be evidence that the person was not read the warning.\n\n\n(d) If the person refuses testing or submits to a test that discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or testing discloses the presence of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis Control Act with a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration as defined in paragraph 6 of subsection (a) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound in the person’s breath, blood, other bodily substance, or urine resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, the law enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the circuit court of venue and the Secretary of State, certifying that the test or tests was or were requested under paragraph (a) and the person refused to submit to a test, or tests, or submitted to testing that disclosed an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, testing discloses the presence of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis Control Act with a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration as defined in paragraph 6 of subsection (a) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound in the person’s breath, blood, other bodily substance, or urine resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If the person is also a CDL holder and refuses testing or submits to a test that discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound in the person’s breath, blood, other bodily substance, or urine resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, the law enforcement officer shall also immediately submit a sworn report to the circuit court of venue and the Secretary of State, certifying that the test or tests was or were requested under paragraph (a) and the person refused to submit to a test, or tests, or submitted to testing that disclosed an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound in the person’s breath, blood, other bodily substance, or urine resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act.\n\n\n(e) Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer submitted under paragraph (d), the Secretary of State shall enter the statutory summary suspension or revocation and disqualification for the periods specified in Sections 6-208.1 and 6-514, respectively, and effective as provided in paragraph (g).\n\n\nIf the person is a first offender as defined in Section 11-500 of this Code, and is not convicted of a violation of Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, then reports received by the Secretary of State under this Section shall, except during the actual time the Statutory Summary Suspension is in effect, be privileged information and for use only by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities or the Secretary of State, unless the person is a CDL holder, is operating a commercial motor vehicle or vehicle required to be placarded for hazardous materials, in which case the suspension shall not be privileged. Reports received by the Secretary of State under this Section shall also be made available to the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 years that holds an instruction permit or a graduated driver’s license, regardless of whether the statutory summary suspension is in effect. A statutory summary revocation shall not be privileged information.\n\n\n(f) The law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report under paragraph (d) shall serve immediate notice of the statutory summary suspension or revocation on the person and the suspension or revocation and disqualification shall be effective as provided in paragraph (g).\n\n\n(1) In cases involving a person who is not a CDL holder where the blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or greater or any amount of a drug, substance, or compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act is established by a subsequent analysis of blood, other bodily substance, or urine or analysis of whole blood or other bodily substance establishes a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration as defined in paragraph 6 of subsection (a) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, collected at the time of arrest, the arresting officer or arresting agency shall give notice as provided in this Section or by deposit in the United States mail of the notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to the person at his or her address as shown on the Uniform Traffic Ticket and the statutory summary suspension shall begin as provided in paragraph (g).\n\n\n(1.3) In cases involving a person who is a CDL holder where the blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or greater or any amount of a drug, substance, or compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis as covered by the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act is established by a subsequent analysis of blood, other bodily substance, or urine collected at the time of arrest, the arresting officer or arresting agency shall give notice as provided in this Section or by deposit in the United States mail of the notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to the person at his or her address as shown on the Uniform Traffic Ticket and the statutory summary suspension and disqualification shall begin as provided in paragraph (g).\n\n\n(1.5) The officer shall confiscate any Illinois driver’s license or permit on the person at the time of arrest.

    "text": "Sec. 11-501.2. Chemical and other tests.\n\n(a) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of an arrest for an offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a similar local ordinance or proceedings pursuant to Section 2-118.1, evidence of the concentration of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination thereof in a person’s blood or breath at the time alleged, as determined by analysis of the person’s blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance, shall be admissible. Where such test is made the following provisions shall apply:\n\n\n\\1. Chemical analyses of the person’s blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance to be considered valid under the provisions of this Section shall have been performed according to standards promulgated by the Illinois State Police by a licensed physician, registered nurse, trained phlebotomist, licensed paramedic, or other individual possessing a valid permit issued by that Department for this purpose. The Director of the Illinois State Police is authorized to approve satisfactory techniques or methods, to ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals to conduct such analyses, to issue permits which shall be subject to termination or revocation at the discretion of that Department and to certify the accuracy of breath testing equipment. The Illinois State Police shall prescribe regulations as necessary to implement this Section.\n\n\n\\2. When a person in this State shall submit to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under the provisions of Section 11-501.1, only a physician authorized to practice medicine, a licensed physician assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, a registered nurse, trained phlebotomist, or licensed paramedic, or other qualified person approved by the Illinois State Police may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug content therein. This limitation shall not apply to the taking of breath, other bodily substance, or urine specimens.\n\n\nWhen a blood test of a person who has been taken to an adjoining state for medical treatment is requested by an Illinois law enforcement officer, the blood may be withdrawn only by a physician authorized to practice medicine in the adjoining state, a licensed physician assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, a registered nurse, a trained phlebotomist acting under the direction of the physician, or licensed paramedic. The law enforcement officer requesting the test shall take custody of the blood sample, and the blood sample shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the Illinois State Police for that purpose.\n\n\n\\3. The person tested may have a physician, or a qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of their own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.\n\n\n\\4. Upon the request of the person who shall submit to a chemical test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or such person’s attorney.\n\n\n\\5. Alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.\n\n\n\\6. Tetrahydrocannabinol concentration means either 5 nanograms or more of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter of other bodily substance.\n\n\n(a-5) Law enforcement officials may use validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration when conducting investigations of a violation of Section 11-501 or similar local ordinance by drivers suspected of driving under the influence of cannabis. The General Assembly finds that (i) validated roadside chemical tests are effective means to determine if a person is under the influence of cannabis and (ii) standardized field sobriety tests approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are divided attention tasks that are intended to determine if a person is under the influence of cannabis. The purpose of these tests is to determine the effect of the use of cannabis on a person’s capacity to think and act with ordinary care and therefore operate a motor vehicle safely. Therefore, the results of these validated roadside chemical tests and standardized field sobriety tests, appropriately administered, shall be admissible in the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of an arrest for a cannabis-related offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a similar local ordinance or proceedings under Section 2-118.1 or 2-118.2. Where a test is made the following provisions shall apply: 1. The person tested may have a physician, or a qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of their own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to the standardized field sobriety test or tests administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person does not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.\n\n\n\\2. Upon the request of the person who shall submit to validated roadside chemical tests or a standardized field sobriety test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney.\n\n\n\\3. At the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of an arrest for an offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a similar local ordinance or proceedings under Section 2-118.1 or 2-118.2 in which the results of these validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests are admitted, the person may present and the trier of fact may consider evidence that the person lacked the physical capacity to perform the validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests.\n\n\n(b) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in the person’s blood or breath at the time alleged as shown by analysis of the person’s blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance shall give rise to the following presumptions: 1. If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.05 or less, it shall be presumed that the person was not under the influence of alcohol.\n\n\n\\2. If there was at that time an alcohol concentration in excess of 0.05 but less than 0.08, such facts shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol, but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.\n\n\n\\3. If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of alcohol.\n\n\n\\4. The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of any other relevant evidence bearing upon the question whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.\n\n\n(b-5) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, intoxicating compound or compounds or any combination thereof, the concentration of cannabis in the person’s whole blood or other bodily substance at the time alleged as shown by analysis of the person’s blood or other bodily substance shall give rise to the following presumptions: 1. If there was a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of 5 nanograms or more in whole blood or 10 nanograms or more in an other bodily substance as defined in this Section, it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of cannabis.\n\n\n\\2. If there was at that time a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of less than 5 nanograms in whole blood or less than 10 nanograms in an other bodily substance, such facts shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of cannabis, but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of cannabis.\n\n\n(c) 1. If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test under the provisions of Section 11-501.1, evidence of refusal shall be admissible in any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination thereof was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle. 2. Notwithstanding any ability to refuse under this Code to submit to these tests or any ability to revoke the implied consent to these tests, if a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle driven by or in actual physical control of a person under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination thereof has caused the death or personal injury to another, the law enforcement officer shall request, and that person shall submit, upon the request of a law enforcement officer, to a chemical test or tests of his or her blood, breath, other bodily substance, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol content thereof or the presence of any other drug or combination of both.\n\n\nThis provision does not affect the applicability of or imposition of driver’s license sanctions under Section 11-501.1 of this Code.\n\n\n\\3. For purposes of this Section, a personal injury includes any Type A injury as indicated on the traffic crash report completed by a law enforcement officer that requires immediate professional attention in either a doctor’s office or a medical facility. A Type A injury includes severe bleeding wounds, distorted extremities, and injuries that require the injured party to be carried from the scene.\n\n\n(d) If a person refuses validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests under Section 11-501.9 of this Code, evidence of refusal shall be admissible in any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts committed while the person was driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle and alleged to have been impaired by the use of cannabis.\n\n\n(e) Illinois State Police compliance with the changes in this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly concerning testing of other bodily substances and tetrahydrocannabinol concentration by Illinois State Police laboratories is subject to appropriation and until the Illinois State Police adopt standards and completion validation. Any laboratories that test for the presence of cannabis or other drugs under this Article, the Snowmobile Registration and Safety Act, or the Boat Registration and Safety Act must comply with ISO/IEC 17025:2005.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-27, eff. 6-25-19; 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 102-982, eff. 7-1-23.)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-501.4) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 11-501.4)"

If the person is also a CDL holder, he or she shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis, as covered by the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act as detected in the person’s blood, other bodily substance, or urine, may result in the disqualification of the person’s privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle, as provided in Section 6-514 of this Code. The length of the suspension shall be the same as outlined in Section 6-208.1 of this Code regarding statutory summary suspensions.\n\n\nA person requested to submit to a test shall also acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the warning required under this Section. If the person refuses to acknowledge receipt of the warning, the law enforcement officer shall make a written notation on the warning that the person refused to sign the warning. A person’s refusal to sign the warning shall not be evidence that the person was not read the warning.\n\n\n(d) If the person refuses testing or submits to a test which discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, the presence of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis Control Act with a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration as defined in paragraph 6 of subsection (a) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound in such person’s blood or urine resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, the law enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the Secretary of State on a form prescribed by the Secretary, certifying that the test or tests were requested under subsection (a) and the person refused to submit to a test or tests or submitted to testing which disclosed an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, the presence of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis Control Act with a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration as defined in paragraph 6 of subsection (a) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound in such person’s blood, other bodily substance, or urine, resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If the person is also a CDL holder and refuses testing or submits to a test which discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound in the person’s blood, other bodily substance, or urine resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, the law enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the Secretary of State on a form prescribed by the Secretary, certifying that the test or tests were requested under subsection (a) and the person refused to submit to a test or tests or submitted to testing which disclosed an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound in such person’s blood, other bodily substance, or urine, resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act.\n\n\nUpon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the Secretary shall enter the suspension and disqualification to the individual’s driving record and the suspension and disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice of the suspension was given to the person.\n\n\nThe law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report shall serve immediate notice of this suspension on the person and such suspension and disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.\n\n\nIn cases involving a person who is not a CDL holder where the blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or blood testing discloses the presence of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis Control Act with a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration as defined in paragraph 6 of subsection (a) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, is established by a subsequent analysis of blood, other bodily substance, or urine collected at the time of arrest, the arresting officer shall give notice as provided in this Section or by deposit in the United States mail of such notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to such person at his or her address as shown on the Uniform Traffic Ticket and the suspension shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.\n\n\nIn cases involving a person who is a CDL holder where the blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, is established by a subsequent analysis of blood, other bodily substance, or urine collected at the time of arrest, the arresting officer shall give notice as provided in this Section or by deposit in the United States mail of such notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to the person at his or her address as shown on the Uniform Traffic Ticket and the suspension and disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.\n\n\nUpon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the Secretary shall also give notice of the suspension and disqualification to the driver by mailing a notice of the effective date of the suspension and disqualification to the individual. However, should the sworn report be defective by not containing sufficient information or be completed in error, the notice of the suspension and disqualification shall not be mailed to the person or entered to the driving record, but rather the sworn report shall be returned to the issuing law enforcement agency.\n\n\n(e) A driver may contest this suspension of his or her driving privileges and disqualification of his or her CDL privileges by requesting an administrative hearing with the Secretary in accordance with Section 2-118 of this Code. At the conclusion of a hearing held under Section 2-118 of this Code, the Secretary may rescind, continue, or modify the orders of suspension and disqualification. If the Secretary does not rescind the orders of suspension and disqualification, a restricted driving permit may be granted by the Secretary upon application being made and good cause shown. A restricted driving permit may be granted to relieve undue hardship to allow driving for employment, educational, and medical purposes as outlined in Section 6-206 of this Code. The provisions of Section 6-206 of this Code shall apply. In accordance with 49 C.F.R. 384, the Secretary of State may not issue a restricted driving permit for the operation of a commercial motor vehicle to a person holding a CDL whose driving privileges have been suspended, revoked, cancelled, or disqualified.\n\n\n(f) (Blank).\n\n\n(g) For the purposes of this Section, a personal injury shall include any type A injury as indicated on the traffic crash report completed by a law enforcement officer that requires immediate professional attention in either a doctor’s office or a medical facility.

    "text": "Sec. 11-501.8. Suspension of driver’s license; persons under age 21.\n\n(a) A person who is less than 21 years of age and who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this State shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test or tests of blood, breath, other bodily substance, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol content of the person’s blood if arrested, as evidenced by the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket for any violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, if a police officer has probable cause to believe that the driver has consumed any amount of an alcoholic beverage based upon evidence of the driver’s physical condition or other first hand knowledge of the police officer. The test or tests shall be administered at the direction of the arresting officer. The law enforcement agency employing the officer shall designate which of the aforesaid tests shall be administered. Up to 2 additional tests of urine or other bodily substance may be administered even after a blood or breath test or both has been administered.\n\n\n(b) A person who is dead, unconscious, or who is otherwise in a condition rendering that person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed not to have withdrawn the consent provided by paragraph (a) of this Section and the test or tests may be administered subject to the following provisions:\n\n\n(i) Chemical analysis of the person’s blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance, to be considered valid under the provisions of this Section, shall have been performed according to standards promulgated by the Illinois State Police by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by that Department for this purpose. The Director of the Illinois State Police is authorized to approve satisfactory techniques or methods, to ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals to conduct analyses, to issue permits that shall be subject to termination or revocation at the direction of that Department, and to certify the accuracy of breath testing equipment. The Illinois State Police shall prescribe regulations as necessary.\n\n\n(ii) When a person submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under the provisions of this Section, only a physician authorized to practice medicine, a licensed physician assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, a registered nurse, or other qualified person trained in venipuncture and acting under the direction of a licensed physician may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol content therein. This limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, other bodily substance, or urine specimens.\n\n\n(iii) The person tested may have a physician, qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of his or her own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any test or tests administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the consideration of the previously performed chemical test.\n\n\n(iv) Upon a request of the person who submits to a chemical test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or that person’s attorney.\n\n\n(v) Alcohol concentration means either grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.\n\n\n(vi) If a driver is receiving medical treatment as a result of a motor vehicle crashes, a physician licensed to practice medicine, licensed physician assistant, licensed advanced practice registered nurse, registered nurse, or other qualified person trained in venipuncture and acting under the direction of a licensed physician shall withdraw blood for testing purposes to ascertain the presence of alcohol upon the specific request of a law enforcement officer. However, that testing shall not be performed until, in the opinion of the medical personnel on scene, the withdrawal can be made without interfering with or endangering the well-being of the patient.\n\n\n(c) A person requested to submit to a test as provided above shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00, may result in the loss of that person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle and may result in the disqualification of the person’s privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle, as provided in Section 6-514 of this Code, if the person is a CDL holder. The loss of driving privileges shall be imposed in accordance with Section 6-208.2 of this Code. A person requested to submit to a test shall also acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the warning required under this Section. If the person refuses to acknowledge receipt of the warning, the law enforcement officer shall make a written notation on the warning that the person refused to sign the warning. A person’s refusal to sign the warning shall not be evidence that the person was not read the warning.\n\n\n(d) If the person refuses testing or submits to a test that discloses an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00, the law enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the Secretary of State on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, certifying that the test or tests were requested under subsection (a) and the person refused to submit to a test or tests or submitted to testing which disclosed an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00. The law enforcement officer shall submit the same sworn report when a person under the age of 21 submits to testing under Section 11-501.1 of this Code and the testing discloses an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 and less than 0.08.\n\n\nUpon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the Secretary of State shall enter the suspension and disqualification on the individual’s driving record and the suspension and disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice of the suspension was given to the person. If this suspension is the individual’s first driver’s license suspension under this Section, reports received by the Secretary of State under this Section shall, except during the time the suspension is in effect, be privileged information and for use only by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities, the Secretary of State, or the individual personally, unless the person is a CDL holder, is operating a commercial motor vehicle or vehicle required to be placarded for hazardous materials, in which case the suspension shall not be privileged. Reports received by the Secretary of State under this Section shall also be made available to the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 years that holds an instruction permit or a graduated driver’s license, regardless of whether the suspension is in effect.\n\n\nThe law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report shall serve immediate notice of this suspension on the person and the suspension and disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.\n\n\nIn cases where the blood alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 is established by a subsequent analysis of blood, other bodily substance, or urine, the police officer or arresting agency shall give notice as provided in this Section or by deposit in the United States mail of that notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to that person at his last known address and the loss of driving privileges shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.\n\n\nUpon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the Secretary of State shall also give notice of the suspension and disqualification to the driver by mailing a notice of the effective date of the suspension and disqualification to the individual. However, should the sworn report be defective by not containing sufficient information or be completed in error, the notice of the suspension and disqualification shall not be mailed to the person or entered to the driving record, but rather the sworn report shall be returned to the issuing law enforcement agency.\n\n\n(e) A driver may contest this suspension and disqualification by requesting an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State in accordance with Section 2-118 of this Code. An individual whose blood alcohol concentration is shown to be more than 0.00 is not subject to this Section if he or she consumed alcohol in the performance of a religious service or ceremony. An individual whose blood alcohol concentration is shown to be more than 0.00 shall not be subject to this Section if the individual’s blood alcohol concentration resulted only from ingestion of the prescribed or recommended dosage of medicine that contained alcohol. The petition for that hearing shall not stay or delay the effective date of the impending suspension. The scope of this hearing shall be limited to the issues of:\n\n\n(1) whether the police officer had probable cause to believe that the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of the State and the police officer had reason to believe that the person was in violation of any provision of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance; and\n\n\n(2) whether the person was issued a Uniform Traffic Ticket for any violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance; and\n\n\n(3) whether the police officer had probable cause to believe that the driver had consumed any amount of an alcoholic beverage based upon the driver’s physical actions or other first-hand knowledge of the police officer; and\n\n\n(4) whether the person, after being advised by the officer that the privilege to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended if the person refused to submit to and complete the test or tests, did refuse to submit to or complete the test or tests to determine the person’s alcohol concentration; and\n\n\n(5) whether the person, after being advised by the officer that the privileges to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended if the person submits to a chemical test or tests and the test or tests disclose an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00, did submit to and complete the test or tests that determined an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00; and\n\n\n(6) whether the test result of an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 was based upon the person’s consumption of alcohol in the performance of a religious service or ceremony; and\n\n\n(7) whether the test result of an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 was based upon the person’s consumption of alcohol through ingestion of the prescribed or recommended dosage of medicine.\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing held under Section 2-118 of this Code, the Secretary of State may rescind, continue, or modify the suspension and disqualification. If the Secretary of State does not rescind the suspension and disqualification, a restricted driving permit may be granted by the Secretary of State upon application being made and good cause shown. A restricted driving permit may be granted to relieve undue hardship by allowing driving for employment, educational, and medical purposes as outlined in item (3) of part (c) of Section 6-206 of this Code. The provisions of item (3) of part (c) of Section 6-206 of this Code and of subsection (f) of that Section shall apply. The Secretary of State shall promulgate rules providing for participation in an alcohol education and awareness program or activity, a drug education and awareness program or activity, or both as a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving permit for suspensions imposed under this Section. (f) The results of any chemical testing performed in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section are not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding, except that the results of the testing may be considered at a hearing held under Section 2-118 of this Code. However, the results of the testing may not be used to impose driver’s license sanctions under Section 11-501.1 of this Code. A law enforcement officer may, however, pursue a statutory summary suspension or revocation of driving privileges under Section 11-501.1 of this Code if other physical evidence or first hand knowledge forms the basis of that suspension or revocation.\n\n\n(g) This Section applies only to drivers who are under age 21 at the time of the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket for a violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, and a chemical test request is made under this Section.\n\n\n(h) The action of the Secretary of State in suspending, revoking, cancelling, or disqualifying any license or permit shall be subject to judicial review in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County or in the Circuit Court of Cook County, and the provisions of the Administrative Review Law and its rules are hereby adopted and shall apply to and govern every action for the judicial review of final acts or decisions of the Secretary of State under this Section.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 102-982, eff. 7-1-23.)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-501.9)"

Suspension of driver’s license; failure or refusal of validated roadside chemical tests; failure or refusal of field sobriety tests; implied consent.\n\n(a) A person who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this State shall be deemed to have given consent to (i) validated roadside chemical tests or (ii) standardized field sobriety tests approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, under subsection (a-5) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, if detained by a law enforcement officer who has a reasonable suspicion that the person is driving or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis. The law enforcement officer must have an independent, cannabis-related factual basis giving reasonable suspicion that the person is driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis for conducting validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests, which shall be included with the results of the validated roadside chemical tests and field sobriety tests in any report made by the law enforcement officer who requests the test. The person’s possession of a registry identification card issued under the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act alone is not a sufficient basis for reasonable suspicion.\n\n\nFor purposes of this Section, a law enforcement officer of this State who is investigating a person for an offense under Section 11-501 of this Code may travel into an adjoining state where the person has been transported for medical care to complete an investigation and to request that the person submit to field sobriety tests under this Section.\n\n\n(b) A person who is unconscious, or otherwise in a condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have withdrawn the consent provided by subsection (a) of this Section.\n\n\n(c) A person requested to submit to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests, as provided in this Section, shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the field sobriety tests that a refusal to submit to the validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle, as provided in subsection (f) of this Section. The person shall also be warned by the law enforcement officer that if the person submits to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests as provided in this Section which disclose the person is impaired by the use of cannabis, a suspension of the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle, as provided in subsection (f) of this Section, will be imposed.\n\n\n(d) The results of validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests administered under this Section shall be admissible in a civil or criminal action or proceeding arising from an arrest for an offense as defined in Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance. These test results shall be admissible only in actions or proceedings directly related to the incident upon which the test request was made.\n\n\n(e) If the person refuses validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests or submits to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests that disclose the person is impaired by the use of cannabis, the law enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the circuit court of venue and the Secretary of State certifying that testing was requested under this Section and that the person refused to submit to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests or submitted to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests that disclosed the person was impaired by the use of cannabis. The sworn report must include the law enforcement officer’s factual basis for reasonable suspicion that the person was impaired by the use of cannabis.\n\n\n(f) Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer submitted under subsection (e) of this Section, the Secretary of State shall enter the suspension to the driving record as follows:\n\n\n(1) for refusal or failure to complete validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests, a 12-month suspension shall be entered; or\n\n\n(2) for submitting to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests that disclosed the driver was impaired by the use of cannabis, a 6-month suspension shall be entered.\n\n\nThe Secretary of State shall confirm the suspension by mailing a notice of the effective date of the suspension to the person and the court of venue. However, should the sworn report be defective for insufficient information or be completed in error, the confirmation of the suspension shall not be mailed to the person or entered to the record; instead, the sworn report shall be forwarded to the court of venue with a copy returned to the issuing agency identifying the defect. (g) The law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report under subsection (e) of this Section shall serve immediate notice of the suspension on the person and the suspension shall be effective as provided in subsection (h) of this Section. If immediate notice of the suspension cannot be given, the arresting officer or arresting agency shall give notice by deposit in the United States mail of the notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to the person at his or her address as shown on the Uniform Traffic Ticket and the suspension shall begin as provided in subsection (h) of this Section. The officer shall confiscate any Illinois driver’s license or permit on the person at the time of arrest. If the person has a valid driver’s license or permit, the officer shall issue the person a receipt, in a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, that will allow the person to drive during the period provided for in subsection (h) of this Section. The officer shall immediately forward the driver’s license or permit to the circuit court of venue along with the sworn report under subsection (e) of this Section.\n\n\n(h) The suspension under subsection (f) of this Section shall take effect on the 46th day following the date the notice of the suspension was given to the person.\n\n\n(i) When a driving privilege has been suspended under this Section and the person is subsequently convicted of violating Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, for the same incident, any period served on suspension under this Section shall be credited toward the minimum period of revocation of driving privileges imposed under Section 6-205 of this Code.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-27, eff. 6-25-19; 101-363, eff. 8-9-19; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21.)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-501.10)"
