He is justified in the use of any force which he reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, to be necessary to effect the arrest and of any force which he reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, to be necessary to defend himself or another from bodily harm while making the arrest. However, he is justified in using force likely to cause death or great bodily harm only when: (i) he reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or such other person; or (ii) when he reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, both that:\n\n\n(1) Such force is necessary to prevent the arrest from being defeated by resistance or escape and the officer reasonably believes that the person to be arrested is likely to cause great bodily harm to another; and\n\n\n(2) The person to be arrested committed or attempted a forcible felony which involves the infliction or threatened infliction of great bodily harm or is attempting to escape by use of a deadly weapon, or otherwise indicates that he will endanger human life or inflict great bodily harm unless arrested without delay.\n\n\nAs used in this subsection, “retreat” does not mean tactical repositioning or other de-escalation tactics.\n\n\nA peace officer is not justified in using force likely to cause death or great bodily harm when there is no longer an imminent threat of great bodily harm to the officer or another.\n\n\n(a-5) Where feasible, a peace officer shall, prior to the use of force, make reasonable efforts to identify himself or herself as a peace officer and to warn that deadly force may be used.\n\n\n(a-10) A peace officer shall not use deadly force against a person based on the danger that the person poses to himself or herself if a reasonable officer would believe the person does not pose an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm to the peace officer or to another person.\n\n\n(a-15) A peace officer shall not use deadly force against a person who is suspected of committing a property offense, unless that offense is terrorism or unless deadly force is otherwise authorized by law.\n\n\n(b) A peace officer making an arrest pursuant to an invalid warrant is justified in the use of any force which he would be justified in using if the warrant were valid, unless he knows that the warrant is invalid.\n\n\n(c) The authority to use physical force conferred on peace officers by this Article is a serious responsibility that shall be exercised judiciously and with respect for human rights and dignity and for the sanctity of every human life.\n\n\n(d) Peace officers shall use deadly force only when reasonably necessary in defense of human life. In determining whether deadly force is reasonably necessary, officers shall evaluate each situation in light of the totality of circumstances of each case, including, but not limited to, the proximity in time of the use of force to the commission of a forcible felony, and the reasonable feasibility of safely apprehending a subject at a later time, and shall use other available resources and techniques, if reasonably safe and feasible to a reasonable officer.\n\n\n(e) The decision by a peace officer to use force shall be evaluated carefully and thoroughly, in a manner that reflects the gravity of that authority and the serious consequences of the use of force by peace officers, in order to ensure that officers use force consistent with law and agency policies.\n\n\n(f) The decision by a peace officer to use force shall be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer in the same situation, based on the totality of the circumstances known to or perceived by the officer at the time of the decision, rather than with the benefit of hindsight, and that the totality of the circumstances shall account for occasions when officers may be forced to make quick judgments about using force.\n\n\n(g) Law enforcement agencies are encouraged to adopt and develop policies designed to protect individuals with physical, mental health, developmental, or intellectual disabilities, or individuals who are significantly more likely to experience greater levels of physical force during police interactions, as these disabilities may affect the ability of a person to understand or comply with commands from peace officers.\n\n\n(h) As used in this Section:\n\n\n(1) “Deadly force” means any use of force that creates a substantial risk of causing death or great bodily harm, including, but not limited to, the discharge of a firearm.\n\n\n(2) A threat of death or serious bodily injury is\n\n\n“imminent” when, based on the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or great bodily harm to the peace officer or another person. An imminent harm is not merely a fear of future harm, no matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm, but is one that, from appearances, must be instantly confronted and addressed.\n\n\n(3) “Totality of the circumstances” means all facts known to the peace officer at the time, or that would be known to a reasonable officer in the same situation, including the conduct of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of deadly force.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-28, eff. 6-25-21; 102-687, eff. 12-17-21.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/7-5.5)"

A defendant who has been found guilty of first degree murder and who at the time of the commission of the offense had attained the age of 18 years or more may be sentenced to natural life imprisonment if (i) the murdered individual was a physician, physician assistant, psychologist, nurse, or advanced practice registered nurse, (ii) the defendant knew or should have known that the murdered individual was a physician, physician assistant, psychologist, nurse, or advanced practice registered nurse, and (iii) the murdered individual was killed in the course of acting in his or her capacity as a physician, physician assistant, psychologist, nurse, or advanced practice registered nurse, or to prevent him or her from acting in that capacity, or in retaliation for his or her acting in that capacity.\n\n\n(c) Consideration of factors in Aggravation and Mitigation.\n\n\nThe court shall consider, or shall instruct the jury to consider any aggravating and any mitigating factors which are relevant to the imposition of the death penalty. Aggravating factors may include but need not be limited to those factors set forth in subsection (b). Mitigating factors may include but need not be limited to the following:\n\n\n(1) the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity;\n\n\n(2) the murder was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, although not such as to constitute a defense to prosecution;\n\n\n(3) the murdered individual was a participant in the defendant’s homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act;\n\n\n(4) the defendant acted under the compulsion of threat or menace of the imminent infliction of death or great bodily harm;\n\n\n(5) the defendant was not personally present during commission of the act or acts causing death;\n\n\n(6) the defendant’s background includes a history of extreme emotional or physical abuse;\n\n\n(7) the defendant suffers from a reduced mental capacity.\n\n\nProvided, however, that an action that does not otherwise mitigate first degree murder cannot qualify as a mitigating factor for first degree murder because of the discovery, knowledge, or disclosure of the victim’s sexual orientation as defined in Section 1-103 of the Illinois Human Rights Act.\n\n\n(d) Separate sentencing hearing.\n\n\nWhere requested by the State, the court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding to determine the existence of factors set forth in subsection (b) and to consider any aggravating or mitigating factors as indicated in subsection (c). The proceeding shall be conducted:\n\n\n(1) before the jury that determined the defendant’s guilt; or\n\n\n(2) before a jury impanelled for the purpose of the proceeding if:\n\n\nA. the defendant was convicted upon a plea of guilty; or\n\n\nB. the defendant was convicted after a trial before the court sitting without a jury; or\n\n\nC. the court for good cause shown discharges the jury that determined the defendant’s guilt; or\n\n\n(3) before the court alone if the defendant waives a jury for the separate proceeding.\n\n\n(e) Evidence and Argument.\n\n\nDuring the proceeding any information relevant to any of the factors set forth in subsection (b) may be presented by either the State or the defendant under the rules governing the admission of evidence at criminal trials. Any information relevant to any additional aggravating factors or any mitigating factors indicated in subsection (c) may be presented by the State or defendant regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing the admission of evidence at criminal trials. The State and the defendant shall be given fair opportunity to rebut any information received at the hearing.\n\n\n(f) Proof.\n\n\nThe burden of proof of establishing the existence of any of the factors set forth in subsection (b) is on the State and shall not be satisfied unless established beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n(g) Procedure - Jury.\n\n\nIf at the separate sentencing proceeding the jury finds that none of the factors set forth in subsection (b) exists, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections. If there is a unanimous finding by the jury that one or more of the factors set forth in subsection (b) exist, the jury shall consider aggravating and mitigating factors as instructed by the court and shall determine whether the sentence of death shall be imposed. If the jury determines unanimously, after weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, that death is the appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to death. If the court does not concur with the jury determination that death is the appropriate sentence, the court shall set forth reasons in writing including what facts or circumstances the court relied upon, along with any relevant documents, that compelled the court to non-concur with the sentence. This document and any attachments shall be part of the record for appellate review. The court shall be bound by the jury’s sentencing determination.\n\n\nIf after weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, one or more jurors determines that death is not the appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.\n\n\n(h) Procedure - No Jury.\n\n\nIn a proceeding before the court alone, if the court finds that none of the factors found in subsection (b) exists, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.\n\n\nIf the Court determines that one or more of the factors set forth in subsection (b) exists, the Court shall consider any aggravating and mitigating factors as indicated in subsection (c). If the Court determines, after weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, that death is the appropriate sentence, the Court shall sentence the defendant to death.\n\n\nIf the court finds that death is not the appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.\n\n\n(h-5) Decertification as a capital case.\n\n\nIn a case in which the defendant has been found guilty of first degree murder by a judge or jury, or a case on remand for resentencing, and the State seeks the death penalty as an appropriate sentence, on the court’s own motion or the written motion of the defendant, the court may decertify the case as a death penalty case if the court finds that the only evidence supporting the defendant’s conviction is the uncorroborated testimony of an informant witness, as defined in Section 115-21 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, concerning the confession or admission of the defendant or that the sole evidence against the defendant is a single eyewitness or single accomplice without any other corroborating evidence. If the court decertifies the case as a capital case under either of the grounds set forth above, the court shall issue a written finding. The State may pursue its right to appeal the decertification pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 604(a)(1). If the court does not decertify the case as a capital case, the matter shall proceed to the eligibility phase of the sentencing hearing.\n\n\n(i) Appellate Procedure.\n\n\nThe conviction and sentence of death shall be subject to automatic review by the Supreme Court. Such review shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by the Supreme Court. The Illinois Supreme Court may overturn the death sentence, and order the imposition of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections if the court finds that the death sentence is fundamentally unjust as applied to the particular case. If the Illinois Supreme Court finds that the death sentence is fundamentally unjust as applied to the particular case, independent of any procedural grounds for relief, the Illinois Supreme Court shall issue a written opinion explaining this finding.\n\n\n(j) Disposition of reversed death sentence.\n\n\nIn the event that the death penalty in this Act is held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States or of the State of Illinois, any person convicted of first degree murder shall be sentenced by the court to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.\n\n\nIn the event that any death sentence pursuant to the sentencing provisions of this Section is declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States or of the State of Illinois, the court having jurisdiction over a person previously sentenced to death shall cause the defendant to be brought before the court, and the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.\n\n\n(k) Guidelines for seeking the death penalty.\n\n\nThe Attorney General and State’s Attorneys Association shall consult on voluntary guidelines for procedures governing whether or not to seek the death penalty. The guidelines do not have the force of law and are only advisory in nature.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 100-460, eff. 1-1-18; 100-513, eff. 1-1-18; 100-863, eff. 8-14-18; 101-223, eff. 1-1-20; 101-652, eff. 7-1-21 .)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/9-1.2) (from Ch. 38, par. 9-1.2)"

    "text": "Sec. 10-5. Child abduction.\n\n(a) For purposes of this Section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n\n\n(1) “Child” means a person who, at the time the alleged violation occurred, was under the age of 18 or was a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability.\n\n\n(2) “Detains” means taking or retaining physical custody of a child, whether or not the child resists or objects.\n\n\n(2.1) “Express consent” means oral or written permission that is positive, direct, and unequivocal, requiring no inference or implication to supply its meaning.\n\n\n(2.2) “Luring” means any knowing act to solicit, entice, tempt, or attempt to attract the minor.\n\n\n(3) “Lawful custodian” means a person or persons granted legal custody of a child or entitled to physical possession of a child pursuant to a court order. It is presumed that, when the parties have never been married to each other, the mother has legal custody of the child unless a valid court order states otherwise. If an adjudication of paternity has been completed and the father has been assigned support obligations or visitation rights, such a paternity order should, for the purposes of this Section, be considered a valid court order granting custody to the mother.\n\n\n(4) “Putative father” means a man who has a reasonable belief that he is the father of a child born of a woman who is not his wife.\n\n\n(5) “Unlawful purpose” means any misdemeanor or felony violation of State law or a similar federal or sister state law or local ordinance.\n\n\n(b) A person commits the offense of child abduction when he or she does any one of the following:\n\n\n(1) Intentionally violates any terms of a valid court order granting sole or joint custody, care, or possession to another by concealing or detaining the child or removing the child from the jurisdiction of the court.\n\n\n(2) Intentionally violates a court order prohibiting the person from concealing or detaining the child or removing the child from the jurisdiction of the court.\n\n\n(3) Intentionally conceals, detains, or removes the child without the consent of the mother or lawful custodian of the child if the person is a putative father and either: (A) the paternity of the child has not been legally established or (B) the paternity of the child has been legally established but no orders relating to custody have been entered. Notwithstanding the presumption created by paragraph (3) of subsection (a), however, a mother commits child abduction when she intentionally conceals or removes a child, whom she has abandoned or relinquished custody of, from an unadjudicated father who has provided sole ongoing care and custody of the child in her absence.\n\n\n(4) Intentionally conceals or removes the child from a parent after filing a petition or being served with process in an action affecting marriage or paternity but prior to the issuance of a temporary or final order determining custody.\n\n\n(5) At the expiration of visitation rights outside the State, intentionally fails or refuses to return or impedes the return of the child to the lawful custodian in Illinois.\n\n\n(6) Being a parent of the child, and if the parents of that child are or have been married and there has been no court order of custody, knowingly conceals the child for 15 days, and fails to make reasonable attempts within the 15-day period to notify the other parent as to the specific whereabouts of the child, including a means by which to contact the child, or to arrange reasonable visitation or contact with the child. It is not a violation of this Section for a person fleeing domestic violence to take the child with him or her to housing provided by a domestic violence program.\n\n\n(7) Being a parent of the child, and if the parents of the child are or have been married and there has been no court order of custody, knowingly conceals, detains, or removes the child with physical force or threat of physical force.\n\n\n(8) Knowingly conceals, detains, or removes the child for payment or promise of payment at the instruction of a person who has no legal right to custody.\n\n\n(9) Knowingly retains in this State for 30 days a child removed from another state without the consent of the lawful custodian or in violation of a valid court order of custody.\n\n\n(10) Intentionally lures or attempts to lure a child:\n\n\n(A) under the age of 17 or (B) while traveling to or from a primary or secondary school into a motor vehicle, building, housetrailer, or dwelling place without the consent of the child’s parent or lawful custodian for other than a lawful purpose. For the purposes of this item (10), the trier of fact may infer that luring or attempted luring of a child under the age of 17 into a motor vehicle, building, housetrailer, or dwelling place without the express consent of the child’s parent or lawful custodian or with the intent to avoid the express consent of the child’s parent or lawful custodian was for other than a lawful purpose.\n\n\n(11) With the intent to obstruct or prevent efforts to locate the child victim of a child abduction, knowingly destroys, alters, conceals, or disguises physical evidence or furnishes false information.\n\n\n(c) It is an affirmative defense to subsections (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this Section that:\n\n\n(1) the person had custody of the child pursuant to a court order granting legal custody or visitation rights that existed at the time of the alleged violation;\n\n\n(2) the person had physical custody of the child pursuant to a court order granting legal custody or visitation rights and failed to return the child as a result of circumstances beyond his or her control, and the person notified and disclosed to the other parent or legal custodian the specific whereabouts of the child and a means by which the child could be contacted or made a reasonable attempt to notify the other parent or lawful custodian of the child of those circumstances and made the disclosure within 24 hours after the visitation period had expired and returned the child as soon as possible;\n\n\n(3) the person was fleeing an incidence or pattern of domestic violence; or\n\n\n(4) the person lured or attempted to lure a child under the age of 17 into a motor vehicle, building, housetrailer, or dwelling place for a lawful purpose in prosecutions under paragraph (10) of subsection (b).\n\n\n(d) A person convicted of child abduction under this Section is guilty of a Class 4 felony. A person convicted of child abduction under subsection (b)(10) shall undergo a sex offender evaluation prior to a sentence being imposed. A person convicted of a second or subsequent violation of paragraph (10) of subsection (b) of this Section is guilty of a Class 3 felony. A person convicted of child abduction under subsection (b)(10) when the person has a prior conviction of a sex offense as defined in the Sex Offender Registration Act or any substantially similar federal, Uniform Code of Military Justice, sister state, or foreign government offense is guilty of a Class 2 felony. It is a factor in aggravation under subsections (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this Section for which a court may impose a more severe sentence under Section 5-8-1 (730 ILCS 5/5-8-1) or Article 4.5 of Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections if, upon sentencing, the court finds evidence of any of the following aggravating factors:\n\n\n(1) that the defendant abused or neglected the child following the concealment, detention, or removal of the child;\n\n\n(2) that the defendant inflicted or threatened to inflict physical harm on a parent or lawful custodian of the child or on the child with intent to cause that parent or lawful custodian to discontinue criminal prosecution of the defendant under this Section;\n\n\n(3) that the defendant demanded payment in exchange for return of the child or demanded that he or she be relieved of the financial or legal obligation to support the child in exchange for return of the child;\n\n\n(4) that the defendant has previously been convicted of child abduction;\n\n\n(5) that the defendant committed the abduction while armed with a deadly weapon or the taking of the child resulted in serious bodily injury to another; or\n\n\n(6) that the defendant committed the abduction while in a school, regardless of the time of day or time of year; in a playground; on any conveyance owned, leased, or contracted by a school to transport students to or from school or a school related activity; on the real property of a school; or on a public way within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising any school or playground. For purposes of this paragraph (6), “playground” means a piece of land owned or controlled by a unit of local government that is designated by the unit of local government for use solely or primarily for children’s recreation; and “school” means a public or private elementary or secondary school, community college, college, or university.\n\n\n(e) The court may order the child to be returned to the parent or lawful custodian from whom the child was concealed, detained, or removed. In addition to any sentence imposed, the court may assess any reasonable expense incurred in searching for or returning the child against any person convicted of violating this Section.\n\n\n(f) Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to limit the court’s contempt power.\n\n\n(g) Every law enforcement officer investigating an alleged incident of child abduction shall make a written police report of any bona fide allegation and the disposition of that investigation. Every police report completed pursuant to this Section shall be compiled and recorded within the meaning of Section 5.1 of the Criminal Identification Act.\n\n\n(h) Whenever a law enforcement officer has reasons to believe a child abduction has occurred, she or he shall provide the lawful custodian a summary of her or his rights under this Code, including the procedures and relief available to her or him.\n\n\n(i) If during the course of an investigation under this Section the child is found in the physical custody of the defendant or another, the law enforcement officer shall return the child to the parent or lawful custodian from whom the child was concealed, detained, or removed, unless there is good cause for the law enforcement officer or the Department of Children and Family Services to retain temporary protective custody of the child pursuant to the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 99-143, eff. 7-27-15.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/10-5.1)"

    "text": "Sec. 11-20. Obscenity.\n\n(a) Elements of the Offense. A person commits obscenity when, with knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof, he or she:\n\n\n(1) Sells, delivers or provides, or offers or agrees to sell, deliver or provide any obscene writing, picture, record or other representation or embodiment of the obscene; or\n\n\n(2) Presents or directs an obscene play, dance or other performance or participates directly in that portion thereof which makes it obscene; or\n\n\n(3) Publishes, exhibits or otherwise makes available anything obscene; or\n\n\n(4) Performs an obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene exhibition of his or her body for gain; or\n\n\n(5) Creates, buys, procures or possesses obscene matter or material with intent to disseminate it in violation of this Section, or of the penal laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction; or\n\n\n(6) Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.\n\n\n(b) Obscene Defined.\n\n\nAny material or performance is obscene if: (1) the average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient interest; and (2) the average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd exhibition of the genitals; and (3) taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\n\n(c) Interpretation of Evidence.\n\n\nObscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults, except that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to such an audience.\n\n\nWhere circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\n\nIn any prosecution for an offense under this Section evidence shall be admissible to show:\n\n\n(1) The character of the audience for which the material was designed or to which it was directed;\n\n\n(2) What the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have on the behavior of such people;\n\n\n(3) The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of the material, or absence thereof;\n\n\n(4) The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this State;\n\n\n(5) Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising or other promotion of the material;\n\n\n(6) Purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator.\n\n\n(d) Sentence.\n\n\nObscenity is a Class A misdemeanor. A second or subsequent offense is a Class 4 felony.\n\n\n(e) Permissive Inference.\n\n\nThe trier of fact may infer an intent to disseminate from the creation, purchase, procurement or possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than 3 copies of obscene material.\n\n\n(f) Affirmative Defenses.\n\n\nIt shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity that the dissemination:\n\n\n(1) Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than children under 18 years of age;\n\n\n(2) Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other special justification for possession of such material.\n\n\n(g) Forfeiture of property. A person who has been convicted previously of the offense of obscenity and who is convicted of a second or subsequent offense of obscenity is subject to the property forfeiture provisions set forth in Article 124B of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 96-712, eff. 1-1-10; 96-1551, eff. 7-1-11 .)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/11-20.1) (from Ch. 38, par. 11-20.1)"

or\n\n\n(4) solicits, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any child whom he or she knows or reasonably should know to be under the age of 18 or a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability to appear in any stage play, live presentation, film, videotape, photograph or other similar visual reproduction or depiction by computer in which the child or person with a severe or profound intellectual disability is or will be depicted, actually or by simulation, in any act, pose or setting described in subparagraphs (i) through (vii) of paragraph (1) of this subsection; or\n\n\n(5) is a parent, step-parent, legal guardian or other person having care or custody of a child whom the person knows or reasonably should know to be under the age of 18 or a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability and who knowingly permits, induces, promotes, or arranges for such child or person with a severe or profound intellectual disability to appear in any stage play, live performance, film, videotape, photograph or other similar visual presentation, portrayal or simulation or depiction by computer of any act or activity described in subparagraphs (i) through (vii) of paragraph (1) of this subsection;

This subsection (a-5) does not apply to multiple copies of the same film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual reproduction or depiction by computer that are identical to each other.\n\n\n(b)(1) It shall be an affirmative defense to a charge of child pornography that the defendant reasonably believed, under all of the circumstances, that the child was 18 years of age or older or that the person was not a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability but only where, prior to the act or acts giving rise to a prosecution under this Section, he or she took some affirmative action or made a bonafide inquiry designed to ascertain whether the child was 18 years of age or older or that the person was not a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability and his or her reliance upon the information so obtained was clearly reasonable.\n\n\n(1.5) Telecommunications carriers, commercial mobile service providers, and providers of information services, including, but not limited to, Internet service providers and hosting service providers, are not liable under this Section by virtue of the transmission, storage, or caching of electronic communications or messages of others or by virtue of the provision of other related telecommunications, commercial mobile services, or information services used by others in violation of this Section.\n\n\n(2) (Blank).\n\n\n(3) The charge of child pornography shall not apply to the performance of official duties by law enforcement or prosecuting officers or persons employed by law enforcement or prosecuting agencies, court personnel or attorneys, nor to bonafide treatment or professional education programs conducted by licensed physicians, psychologists or social workers. In any criminal proceeding, any property or material that constitutes child pornography shall remain in the care, custody, and control of either the State or the court. A motion to view the evidence shall comply with subsection (e-5) of this Section.\n\n\n(4) If the defendant possessed more than one of the same film, videotape or visual reproduction or depiction by computer in which child pornography is depicted, then the trier of fact may infer that the defendant possessed such materials with the intent to disseminate them.\n\n\n(5) The charge of child pornography does not apply to a person who does not voluntarily possess a film, videotape, or visual reproduction or depiction by computer in which child pornography is depicted. Possession is voluntary if the defendant knowingly procures or receives a film, videotape, or visual reproduction or depiction for a sufficient time to be able to terminate his or her possession.\n\n\n(6) Any violation of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (7) of subsection (a) that includes a child engaged in, solicited for, depicted in, or posed in any act of sexual penetration or bound, fettered, or subject to sadistic, masochistic, or sadomasochistic abuse in a sexual context shall be deemed a crime of violence.\n\n\n(c) If the violation does not involve a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (1), (4), (5), or (7) of subsection (a) is a Class 1 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $2,000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation involves a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (1), (4), (5), or (7) of subsection (a) is a Class X felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $2,000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation does not involve a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (3) of subsection (a) is a Class 1 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1500 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation involves a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (3) of subsection (a) is a Class X felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1500 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation does not involve a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) is a Class 1 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation involves a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) is a Class X felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation does not involve a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (6) of subsection (a) is a Class 3 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation involves a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (6) of subsection (a) is a Class 2 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1000 and a maximum fine of $100,000.\n\n\n(c-5) Where the child depicted is under the age of 13, a violation of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (7) of subsection (a) is a Class X felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $2,000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. Where the child depicted is under the age of 13, a violation of paragraph (6) of subsection (a) is a Class 2 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1,000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. Where the child depicted is under the age of 13, a person who commits a violation of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (7) of subsection (a) where the defendant has previously been convicted under the laws of this State or any other state of the offense of child pornography, aggravated child pornography, aggravated criminal sexual abuse, aggravated criminal sexual assault, predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, or any of the offenses formerly known as rape, deviate sexual assault, indecent liberties with a child, or aggravated indecent liberties with a child where the victim was under the age of 18 years or an offense that is substantially equivalent to those offenses, is guilty of a Class X felony for which the person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 9 years with a mandatory minimum fine of $2,000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. Where the child depicted is under the age of 13, a person who commits a violation of paragraph (6) of subsection (a) where the defendant has previously been convicted under the laws of this State or any other state of the offense of child pornography, aggravated child pornography, aggravated criminal sexual abuse, aggravated criminal sexual assault, predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, or any of the offenses formerly known as rape, deviate sexual assault, indecent liberties with a child, or aggravated indecent liberties with a child where the victim was under the age of 18 years or an offense that is substantially equivalent to those offenses, is guilty of a Class 1 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1,000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. The issue of whether the child depicted is under the age of 13 is an element of the offense to be resolved by the trier of fact.\n\n\n(d) If a person is convicted of a second or subsequent violation of this Section within 10 years of a prior conviction, the court shall order a presentence psychiatric examination of the person. The examiner shall report to the court whether treatment of the person is necessary.\n\n\n(e) Any film, videotape, photograph or other similar visual reproduction or depiction by computer which includes a child under the age of 18 or a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability engaged in any activity described in subparagraphs (i) through (vii) or paragraph 1 of subsection (a), and any material or equipment used or intended for use in photographing, filming, printing, producing, reproducing, manufacturing, projecting, exhibiting, depiction by computer, or disseminating such material shall be seized and forfeited in the manner, method and procedure provided by Section 36-1 of this Code for the seizure and forfeiture of vessels, vehicles and aircraft.\n\n\nIn addition, any person convicted under this Section is subject to the property forfeiture provisions set forth in Article 124B of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.\n\n\n(e-5) Upon the conclusion of a case brought under this Section, the court shall seal all evidence depicting a victim or witness that is sexually explicit. The evidence may be unsealed and viewed, on a motion of the party seeking to unseal and view the evidence, only for good cause shown and in the discretion of the court. The motion must expressly set forth the purpose for viewing the material. The State’s attorney and the victim, if possible, shall be provided reasonable notice of the hearing on the motion to unseal the evidence. Any person entitled to notice of a hearing under this subsection (e-5) may object to the motion.\n\n\n(f) Definitions. For the purposes of this Section:\n\n\n(1) “Disseminate” means (i) to sell, distribute, exchange or transfer possession, whether with or without consideration or (ii) to make a depiction by computer available for distribution or downloading through the facilities of any telecommunications network or through any other means of transferring computer programs or data to a computer.\n\n\n(2) “Produce” means to direct, promote, advertise, publish, manufacture, issue, present or show.\n\n\n(3) “Reproduce” means to make a duplication or copy.\n\n\n(4) “Depict by computer” means to generate or create, or cause to be created or generated, a computer program or data that, after being processed by a computer either alone or in conjunction with one or more computer programs, results in a visual depiction on a computer monitor, screen, or display.\n\n\n(5) “Depiction by computer” means a computer program or data that, after being processed by a computer either alone or in conjunction with one or more computer programs, results in a visual depiction on a computer monitor, screen, or display.\n\n\n(6) “Computer”, “computer program”, and “data” have the meanings ascribed to them in Section 17.05 of this Code.\n\n\n(7) For the purposes of this Section, “child pornography” includes a film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual medium or reproduction or depiction by computer that is, or appears to be, that of a person, either in part, or in total, under the age of 18 or a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability, regardless of the method by which the film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual medium or reproduction or depiction by computer is created, adopted, or modified to appear as such. “Child pornography” also includes a film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual medium or reproduction or depiction by computer that is advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression that the film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual medium or reproduction or depiction by computer is of a person under the age of 18 or a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability.\n\n\n(g) Re-enactment; findings; purposes.\n\n\n(1) The General Assembly finds and declares that:\n\n\n(i) Section 50-5 of Public Act 88-680, effective January 1, 1995, contained provisions amending the child pornography statute, Section 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961. Section 50-5 also contained other provisions.\n\n\n(ii) In addition, Public Act 88-680 was entitled “AN ACT to create a Safe Neighborhoods Law”. (A) Article 5 was entitled JUVENILE JUSTICE and amended the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. (B) Article 15 was entitled GANGS and amended various provisions of the Criminal Code of 1961 and the Unified Code of Corrections. (C) Article 20 was entitled ALCOHOL ABUSE and amended various provisions of the Illinois Vehicle Code. (D) Article 25 was entitled DRUG ABUSE and amended the Cannabis Control Act and the Illinois Controlled Substances Act. (E) Article 30 was entitled FIREARMS and amended the Criminal Code of 1961 and the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. (F) Article 35 amended the Criminal Code of 1961, the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and the Unified Code of Corrections. (G) Article 40 amended the Criminal Code of 1961 to increase the penalty for compelling organization membership of persons. (H) Article 45 created the Secure Residential Youth Care Facility Licensing Act and amended the State Finance Act, the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Unified Code of Corrections, and the Private Correctional Facility Moratorium Act. (I) Article 50 amended the WIC Vendor Management Act, the Firearm Owners Identification Card Act, the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Criminal Code of 1961, the Wrongs to Children Act, and the Unified Code of Corrections.\n\n\n(iii) On September 22, 1998, the Third District Appellate Court in People v. Dainty, 701 N.E. 2d 118, ruled that Public Act 88-680 violates the single subject clause of the Illinois Constitution (Article IV, Section 8 (d)) and was unconstitutional in its entirety. As of the time this amendatory Act of 1999 was prepared, People v. Dainty was still subject to appeal.\n\n\n(iv) Child pornography is a vital concern to the people of this State and the validity of future prosecutions under the child pornography statute of the Criminal Code of 1961 is in grave doubt.\n\n\n(2) It is the purpose of this amendatory Act of 1999 to prevent or minimize any problems relating to prosecutions for child pornography that may result from challenges to the constitutional validity of Public Act 88-680 by re-enacting the Section relating to child pornography that was included in Public Act 88-680.\n\n\n(3) This amendatory Act of 1999 re-enacts Section 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961, as it has been amended. This re-enactment is intended to remove any question as to the validity or content of that Section; it is not intended to supersede any other Public Act that amends the text of the Section as set forth in this amendatory Act of 1999. The material is shown as existing text (i.e., without underscoring) because, as of the time this amendatory Act of 1999 was prepared, People v. Dainty was subject to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.\n\n\n(4) The re-enactment by this amendatory Act of 1999 of Section 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961 relating to child pornography that was amended by Public Act 88-680 is not intended, and shall not be construed, to imply that Public Act 88-680 is invalid or to limit or impair any legal argument concerning whether those provisions were substantially re-enacted by other Public Acts.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-87, eff. 1-1-20; 102-567, eff. 1-1-22 .)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/11-20.1A)"

Injunction in connection with criminal housing management or aggravated criminal housing management.\n\n(a) In addition to any other remedies, the State’s Attorney of the county where the residential property which endangers the health or safety of any person exists is authorized to file a complaint and apply to the circuit court for a temporary restraining order, and such circuit court shall upon hearing grant a temporary restraining order or a preliminary or permanent injunction, without bond, restraining any person who owns, manages, or has any equitable interest in the property, from collecting, receiving or benefiting from any rents or other monies available from the property, so long as the property remains in a condition which endangers the health or safety of any person.\n\n\n(b) The court may order any rents or other monies owed to be paid into an escrow account. The funds are to be paid out of the escrow account only to satisfy the reasonable cost of necessary repairs of the property which had been incurred or will be incurred in ameliorating the condition of the property as described in subsection (a), payment of delinquent real estate taxes on the property or payment of other legal debts relating to the property. The court may order that funds remain in escrow for a reasonable time after the completion of all necessary repairs to assure continued upkeep of the property and satisfaction of other outstanding legal debts of the property.\n\n\n(c) The owner shall be responsible for contracting to have necessary repairs completed and shall be required to submit all bills, together with certificates of completion, to the manager of the escrow account within 30 days after their receipt by the owner.\n\n\n(d) In contracting for any repairs required pursuant to this Section the owner of the property shall enter into a contract only after receiving bids from at least 3 independent contractors capable of making the necessary repairs. If the owner does not contract for the repairs with the lowest bidder, he shall file an affidavit with the court explaining why the lowest bid was not acceptable. At no time, under the provisions of this Section, shall the owner contract with anyone who is not a licensed contractor, except that a contractor need not be licensed if neither the State nor the county, township, or municipality where the residential real estate is located requires that the contractor be licensed. The court may order release of those funds in the escrow account that are in excess of the monies that the court determines to its satisfaction are needed to correct the condition of the property as described in subsection (a).\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Section, “licensed contractor” means: (i) a contractor licensed by the State, if the State requires the licensure of the contractor; or (ii) a contractor licensed by the county, township, or municipality where the residential real estate is located, if that jurisdiction requires the licensure of the contractor.\n\n\n(e) The Clerk of the Circuit Court shall maintain a separate trust account entitled “Property Improvement Trust Account”, which shall serve as the depository for the escrowed funds prescribed by this Section. The Clerk of the Court shall be responsible for the receipt, disbursement, monitoring and maintenance of all funds entrusted to this account, and shall provide to the court a quarterly accounting of the activities for any property, with funds in such account, unless the court orders accountings on a more frequent basis.\n\n\nThe Clerk of the Circuit Court shall promulgate rules and procedures to administer the provisions of this Act.\n\n\n(f) Nothing in this Section shall in any way be construed to limit or alter any existing liability incurred, or to be incurred, by the owner or manager except as expressly provided in this Act. Nor shall anything in this Section be construed to create any liability on behalf of the Clerk of the Court, the State’s Attorney’s office or any other governmental agency involved in this action.\n\n\nNor shall anything in this Section be construed to authorize tenants to refrain from paying rent.\n\n\n(g) Costs. As part of the costs of an action under this Section, the court shall assess a reasonable fee against the defendant to be paid to the Clerk of the Circuit Court. This amount is to be used solely for the maintenance of the Property Improvement Trust Account. No money obtained directly or indirectly from the property subject to the case may be used to satisfy this cost.\n\n\n(h) The municipal building department or other entity responsible for inspection of property and the enforcement of such local requirements shall, within 5 business days of a request by the State’s Attorney, provide all documents requested, which shall include, but not be limited to, all records of inspections, permits and other information relating to any property.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 96-1551, eff. 7-1-11 .)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/12-5.3)\n\n(was 720 ILCS 5/12-2.6)"

The court shall review the petition for leave to pay attorney’s fees, and if the court determines that the fees requested are reasonable, the court shall permit the petitioners to pay them. If the court determines that the fees requested are not reasonable, the court shall determine and set the reasonable attorney’s fees of the biological parents’ attorney which may be paid by the petitioners. The prospective adoptive parents shall present a final accounting of all those fees to the court prior to the entry of a final judgment order for adoption.\n\n\n(10) The court may appoint a guardian ad litem for an unborn child to represent the interests of the child in proceedings under this subsection (d).\n\n\n(11) The provisions of this subsection (d) apply to a person who is a prospective adoptive parent.

permissive inference. The trier of fact may infer evidence that a person intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use or benefit of the property (1) if a lessee of the personal property of another fails to return it to the owner within 10 days after written demand from the owner for its return or (2) if a lessee of the personal property of another fails to return it to the owner within 24 hours after written demand from the owner for its return and the lessee had presented identification to the owner that contained a materially fictitious name, address, or telephone number. A notice in writing, given after the expiration of the leasing agreement, addressed and mailed, by registered mail, to the lessee at the address given by him and shown on the leasing agreement shall constitute proper demand.\n\n\n(e) Permissive inference; evidence of intent that a person obtains by deception control over property.

This provision shall not apply where the owner initiated the suspension of performance under the agreement, or where the promisor responds to the notice within the 45-day notice period. A notice in writing, addressed and mailed, by registered mail, to the promisor at the last known address of the promisor, shall constitute proper demand.\n\n\n(f) Offender’s interest in the property.\n\n\n(1) It is no defense to a charge of theft of property that the offender has an interest therein, when the owner also has an interest to which the offender is not entitled.\n\n\n(2) Where the property involved is that of the offender’s spouse, no prosecution for theft may be maintained unless the parties were not living together as man and wife and were living in separate abodes at the time of the alleged theft.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-394, eff. 1-1-20 .)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/16-1.1)"

    "text": "Sec. 16-25. Retail theft.\n\n(a) A person commits retail theft when he or she knowingly:\n\n\n(1) Takes possession of, carries away, transfers or causes to be carried away or transferred any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment with the intention of retaining such merchandise or with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail value of such merchandise; or\n\n\n(2) Alters, transfers, or removes any label, price tag, marking, indicia of value or any other markings which aid in determining value affixed to any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment and attempts to purchase such merchandise at less than the full retail value with the intention of depriving the merchant of the full retail value of such merchandise; or\n\n\n(3) Transfers any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment from the container in or on which such merchandise is displayed to any other container with the intention of depriving the merchant of the full retail value of such merchandise; or\n\n\n(4) Under-rings with the intention of depriving the merchant of the full retail value of the merchandise; or\n\n\n(5) Removes a shopping cart from the premises of a retail mercantile establishment without the consent of the merchant given at the time of such removal with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the possession, use or benefit of such cart; or\n\n\n(6) Represents to a merchant that he, she, or another is the lawful owner of property, knowing that such representation is false, and conveys or attempts to convey that property to a merchant who is the owner of the property in exchange for money, merchandise credit or other property of the merchant; or\n\n\n(7) Uses or possesses any theft detection shielding device or theft detection device remover with the intention of using such device to deprive the merchant permanently of the possession, use or benefit of any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment without paying the full retail value of such merchandise; or\n\n\n(8) Obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner and thereby intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use or benefit of the property when a lessee of the personal property of another fails to return it to the owner, or if the lessee fails to pay the full retail value of such property to the lessor in satisfaction of any contractual provision requiring such, within 10 days after written demand from the owner for its return. A notice in writing, given after the expiration of the leasing agreement, by registered mail, to the lessee at the address given by the lessee and shown on the leasing agreement shall constitute proper demand.\n\n\n(b) Theft by emergency exit. A person commits theft by emergency exit when he or she commits a retail theft as defined in subdivisions (a)(1) through (a)(8) of this Section and to facilitate the theft he or she leaves the retail mercantile establishment by use of a designated emergency exit.\n\n\n(c) Permissive inference. If any person:\n\n\n(1) conceals upon his or her person or among his or her belongings unpurchased merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment; and\n\n\nstation for receiving payments for that merchandise in that retail mercantile establishment, then the trier of fact may infer that the person possessed, carried away or transferred such merchandise with the intention of retaining it or with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail value of such merchandise.\n\n\nTo “conceal” merchandise means that, although there may be some notice of its presence, that merchandise is not visible through ordinary observation.\n\n\n(d) Venue. Multiple thefts committed by the same person as part of a continuing course of conduct in different jurisdictions that have been aggregated in one jurisdiction may be prosecuted in any jurisdiction in which one or more of the thefts occurred.\n\n\n(e) For the purposes of this Section, “theft detection shielding device” means any laminated or coated bag or device designed and intended to shield merchandise from detection by an electronic or magnetic theft alarm sensor.\n\n\n(f) Sentence.\n\n\n(1) A violation of any of subdivisions (a)(1) through\n\n\n(a)(6) and (a)(8) of this Section, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300 for property other than motor fuel or $150 for motor fuel, is a Class A misdemeanor. A violation of subdivision (a)(7) of this Section is a Class A misdemeanor for a first offense and a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent offense. Theft by emergency exit of property, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300, is a Class 4 felony.\n\n\n(2) A person who has been convicted of retail theft of property under any of subdivisions (a)(1) through (a)(6) and (a)(8) of this Section, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300 for property other than motor fuel or $150 for motor fuel, and who has been previously convicted of any type of theft, robbery, armed robbery, burglary, residential burglary, possession of burglary tools, home invasion, unlawful use of a credit card, or forgery is guilty of a Class 4 felony. A person who has been convicted of theft by emergency exit of property, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300, and who has been previously convicted of any type of theft, robbery, armed robbery, burglary, residential burglary, possession of burglary tools, home invasion, unlawful use of a credit card, or forgery is guilty of a Class 3 felony.\n\n\n(3) Any retail theft of property under any of subdivisions (a)(1) through (a)(6) and (a)(8) of this Section, the full retail value of which exceeds $300 for property other than motor fuel or $150 for motor fuel in a single transaction, or in separate transactions committed by the same person as part of a continuing course of conduct from one or more mercantile establishments over a period of one year, is a Class 3 felony. Theft by emergency exit of property, the full retail value of which exceeds $300 in a single transaction, or in separate transactions committed by the same person as part of a continuing course of conduct from one or more mercantile establishments over a period of one year, is a Class 2 felony. When a charge of retail theft of property or theft by emergency exit of property, the full value of which exceeds $300, is brought, the value of the property involved is an element of the offense to be resolved by the trier of fact as either exceeding or not exceeding $300.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 97-597, eff. 1-1-12.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/16-25.1)"

If the State’s Attorney contracts with a private entity to perform any services in operating the program, the entity shall operate under the supervision, direction, and control of the State’s Attorney. Any private entity providing services under this Section is not a “collection agency” as that term is defined under the Collection Agency Act.\n\n\n(c) If an offender is referred to the State’s Attorney, the State’s Attorney may determine whether the offender is appropriate for acceptance in the program. The State’s Attorney may consider, but shall not be limited to consideration of, the following factors:\n\n\n(1) the amount of the check that was drawn or passed;\n\n\n(2) prior referrals of the offender to the program;\n\n\n(3) whether other charges of deceptive practices are pending against the offender;\n\n\n(4) the evidence presented to the State’s Attorney regarding the facts and circumstances of the incident;\n\n\n(5) the offender’s criminal history; and\n\n\n(6) the reason the check was dishonored by the financial institution.\n\n\n(d) The bad check diversion program may require an offender to do one or more of the following:\n\n\n(i) pay for, at his or her own expense, and successfully complete an educational class held by the State’s Attorney or a private entity under contract with the State’s Attorney;\n\n\n(ii) make full restitution for the offense;\n\n\n(iii) pay a per-check administrative fee as set forth in this Section.\n\n\n(e) If an offender is diverted to the program, the State’s Attorney shall agree in writing not to prosecute the offender upon the offender’s successful completion of the program conditions. The State’s Attorney’s agreement to divert the offender shall specify the offenses that will not be prosecuted by identifying the checks involved in the transactions.\n\n\n(f) The State’s Attorney, or private entity under contract with the State’s Attorney, may collect a fee from an offender diverted to the State’s Attorney’s bad check diversion program. This fee may be deposited in a bank account maintained by the State’s Attorney for the purpose of depositing fees and paying the expenses of the program or for use in the enforcement and prosecution of criminal laws. The State’s Attorney may require that the fee be paid directly to a private entity that administers the program under a contract with the State’s Attorney. The amount of the administrative fees collected by the State’s Attorney under the program may not exceed $35 per check. The county board may, however, by ordinance, increase the fees allowed by this Section if the increase is justified by an acceptable cost study showing that the fees allowed by this Section are not sufficient to cover the cost of providing the service.\n\n\n(g)\n\n\n(1) The private entity shall be required to maintain adequate general liability insurance of $1,000,000 per occurrence as well as adequate coverage for potential loss resulting from employee dishonesty. The State’s Attorney may require a surety bond payable to the State’s Attorney if in the State’s Attorney’s opinion it is determined that the private entity is not adequately insured or funded.\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n(A) Each private entity that has a contract with the State’s Attorney to conduct a bad check diversion program shall at all times maintain a separate bank account in which all moneys received from the offenders participating in the program shall be deposited, referred to as a “trust account”, except that negotiable instruments received may be forwarded directly to a victim of the deceptive practice committed by the offender if that procedure is provided for by a writing executed by the victim. Moneys received shall be so deposited within 5 business days after posting to the private entity’s books of account. There shall be sufficient funds in the trust account at all times to pay the victims the amount due them.\n\n\n(B) The trust account shall be established in a financial institution which is federally or State insured or otherwise secured as defined by rule. If the account is interest bearing, the private entity shall pay to the victim interest earned on funds on deposit after the 60th day.\n\n\n(C) Each private entity shall keep on file the name of the financial institution in which each trust account is maintained, the name of each trust account, and the names of the persons authorized to withdraw funds from each account. The private entity, within 30 days of the time of a change of depository or person authorized to make withdrawal, shall update its files to reflect that change. An examination and audit of a private entity’s trust accounts may be made by the State’s Attorney as the State’s Attorney deems appropriate. A trust account financial report shall be submitted annually on forms acceptable to the State’s Attorney.\n\n\n(3) The State’s Attorney may cancel a contract entered into with a private entity under this Section for any one or any combination of the following causes:\n\n\n(A) Conviction of the private entity or the principals of the private entity of any crime under the laws of any U.S. jurisdiction which is a felony, a misdemeanor an essential element of which is dishonesty, or of any crime which directly relates to the practice of the profession.\n\n\n(B) A determination that the private entity has engaged in conduct prohibited in item (4).\n\n\n(4) The State’s Attorney may determine whether the private entity has engaged in the following prohibited conduct:\n\n\n(A) Using or threatening to use force or violence to cause physical harm to an offender, his or her family, or his or her property.\n\n\n(B) Threatening the seizure, attachment, or sale of an offender’s property where such action can only be taken pursuant to court order without disclosing that prior court proceedings are required.\n\n\n(C) Disclosing or threatening to disclose information adversely affecting an offender’s reputation for creditworthiness with knowledge the information is false.\n\n\n(D) Initiating or threatening to initiate communication with an offender’s employer unless there has been a default of the payment of the obligation for at least 30 days and at least 5 days prior written notice, to the last known address of the offender, of the intention to communicate with the employer has been given to the employee, except as expressly permitted by law or court order.\n\n\n(E) Communicating with the offender or any member of the offender’s family at such a time of day or night and with such frequency as to constitute harassment of the offender or any member of the offender’s family. For purposes of this clause (E) the following conduct shall constitute harassment:\n\n\n(i) Communicating with the offender or any member of his or her family at any unusual time or place or a time or place known or which should be known to be inconvenient to the offender. In the absence of knowledge of circumstances to the contrary, a private entity shall assume that the convenient time for communicating with a consumer is after 8 o’clock a.m. and before 9 o’clock p.m. local time at the offender’s residence.\n\n\n(ii) The threat of publication or publication of a list of offenders who allegedly refuse to pay restitution, except by the State’s Attorney.\n\n\n(iii) The threat of advertisement or advertisement for sale of any restitution to coerce payment of the restitution.\n\n\n(iv) Causing a telephone to ring or engaging any person in telephone conversation repeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass any person at the called number.\n\n\n(v) Using profane, obscene or abusive language in communicating with an offender, his or her family, or others.\n\n\n(vi) Disclosing or threatening to disclose information relating to a offender’s case to any other person except the victim and appropriate law enforcement personnel.\n\n\n(vii) Disclosing or threatening to disclose information concerning the alleged criminal act which the private entity knows to be reasonably disputed by the offender without disclosing the fact that the offender disputes the accusation.\n\n\n(viii) Engaging in any conduct which the\n\n\nState’s Attorney finds was intended to cause and did cause mental or physical illness to the offender or his or her family.\n\n\n(ix) Attempting or threatening to enforce a right or remedy with knowledge or reason to know that the right or remedy does not exist.\n\n\n(x) Except as authorized by the State’s\n\n\nAttorney, using any form of communication which simulates legal or judicial process or which gives the appearance of being authorized, issued or approved by a governmental agency or official or by an attorney at law when it is not.\n\n\n(xi) Using any badge, uniform, or other indicia of any governmental agency or official, except as authorized by law or by the State’s Attorney.\n\n\n(xii) Except as authorized by the State’s\n\n\nAttorney, conducting business under any name or in any manner which suggests or implies that the private entity is bonded if such private entity is or is a branch of or is affiliated with any governmental agency or court if such private entity is not.\n\n\n(xiii) Misrepresenting the amount of the restitution alleged to be owed.\n\n\n(xiv) Except as authorized by the State’s\n\n\nAttorney, representing that an existing restitution amount may be increased by the addition of attorney’s fees, investigation fees, or any other fees or charges when those fees or charges may not legally be added to the existing restitution.\n\n\n(xv) Except as authorized by the State’s\n\n\nAttorney, representing that the private entity is an attorney at law or an agent for an attorney if the entity is not.\n\n\n(xvi) Collecting or attempting to collect any interest or other charge or fee in excess of the actual restitution or claim unless the interest or other charge or fee is expressly authorized by the State’s Attorney, who shall determine what constitutes a reasonable collection fee.\n\n\n(xvii) Communicating or threatening to communicate with an offender when the private entity is informed in writing by an attorney that the attorney represents the offender concerning the claim, unless authorized by the attorney.

As used in this Section, a “gambling device” includes any slot machine, and includes any machine or device constructed for the reception of money or other thing of value and so constructed as to return, or to cause someone to return, on chance to the player thereof money, property or a right to receive money or property. With the exception of any device designed for gambling which is incapable of lawful use, no gambling device shall be forfeited or destroyed unless an individual with a property interest in said device knows of the unlawful use of the device.\n\n\n(b) Every gambling device shall be seized and forfeited to the county wherein such seizure occurs. Any money or other thing of value integrally related to acts of gambling shall be seized and forfeited to the county wherein such seizure occurs.\n\n\n(c) If, within 60 days after any seizure pursuant to subparagraph (b) of this Section, a person having any property interest in the seized property is charged with an offense, the court which renders judgment upon such charge shall, within 30 days after such judgment, conduct a forfeiture hearing to determine whether such property was a gambling device at the time of seizure. Such hearing shall be commenced by a written petition by the State, including material allegations of fact, the name and address of every person determined by the State to have any property interest in the seized property, a representation that written notice of the date, time and place of such hearing has been mailed to every such person by certified mail at least 10 days before such date, and a request for forfeiture. Every such person may appear as a party and present evidence at such hearing. The quantum of proof required shall be a preponderance of the evidence, and the burden of proof shall be on the State. If the court determines that the seized property was a gambling device at the time of seizure, an order of forfeiture and disposition of the seized property shall be entered: a gambling device shall be received by the State’s Attorney, who shall effect its destruction, except that valuable parts thereof may be liquidated and the resultant money shall be deposited in the general fund of the county wherein such seizure occurred; money and other things of value shall be received by the State’s Attorney and, upon liquidation, shall be deposited in the general fund of the county wherein such seizure occurred. However, in the event that a defendant raises the defense that the seized slot machine is an antique slot machine described in subparagraph (b) (7) of Section 28-1 of this Code and therefore he is exempt from the charge of a gambling activity participant, the seized antique slot machine shall not be destroyed or otherwise altered until a final determination is made by the Court as to whether it is such an antique slot machine. Upon a final determination by the Court of this question in favor of the defendant, such slot machine shall be immediately returned to the defendant. Such order of forfeiture and disposition shall, for the purposes of appeal, be a final order and judgment in a civil proceeding.\n\n\n(d) If a seizure pursuant to subparagraph (b) of this Section is not followed by a charge pursuant to subparagraph (c) of this Section, or if the prosecution of such charge is permanently terminated or indefinitely discontinued without any judgment of conviction or acquittal (1) the State’s Attorney shall commence an in rem proceeding for the forfeiture and destruction of a gambling device, or for the forfeiture and deposit in the general fund of the county of any seized money or other things of value, or both, in the circuit court and (2) any person having any property interest in such seized gambling device, money or other thing of value may commence separate civil proceedings in the manner provided by law.\n\n\n(e) Any gambling device displayed for sale to a riverboat gambling operation, casino gambling operation, or organization gaming facility or used to train occupational licensees of a riverboat gambling operation, casino gambling operation, or organization gaming facility as authorized under the Illinois Gambling Act is exempt from seizure under this Section.\n\n\n(f) Any gambling equipment, devices, and supplies provided by a licensed supplier in accordance with the Illinois Gambling Act which are removed from a riverboat, casino, or organization gaming facility for repair are exempt from seizure under this Section.\n\n\n(g) The following video gaming terminals are exempt from seizure under this Section:\n\n\n(1) Video gaming terminals for sale to a licensed distributor or operator under the Video Gaming Act.\n\n\n(2) Video gaming terminals used to train licensed technicians or licensed terminal handlers.\n\n\n(3) Video gaming terminals that are removed from a licensed establishment, licensed truck stop establishment, licensed large truck stop establishment, licensed fraternal establishment, or licensed veterans establishment for repair.\n\n\n(h) Property seized or forfeited under this Section is subject to reporting under the Seizure and Forfeiture Reporting Act.\n\n\n(i) Any sports lottery terminals provided by a central system provider that are removed from a lottery retailer for repair under the Sports Wagering Act are exempt from seizure under this Section.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-31, Article 25, Section 25-915, eff. 6-28-19; 101-31, Article 35, Section 35-80, eff. 6-28-19; 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/28-7) (from Ch. 38, par. 28-7)"

If authorized by law, a forfeiture shall be ordered by a court on an action in rem brought by a State’s Attorney under a verified complaint for forfeiture.\n\n\n(2) A complaint of forfeiture shall include:\n\n\n(A) a description of the property seized;\n\n\n(B) the date and place of seizure of the property;\n\n\n(C) the name and address of the law enforcement agency making the seizure; and\n\n\n(D) the specific statutory and factual grounds for the seizure.\n\n\n(3) The complaint shall be served upon the person from whom the property was seized and all persons known or reasonably believed by the State to claim an interest in the property, as provided in Section 29B-10 of this Article. The complaint shall be accompanied by the following written notice:\n\n\n“This is a civil court proceeding subject to the Code of Civil Procedure. You received this Complaint of Forfeiture because the State’s Attorney’s office has brought a legal action seeking forfeiture of your seized property. This complaint starts the court process where the State seeks to prove that your property should be forfeited and not returned to you. This process is also your opportunity to try to prove to a judge that you should get your property back. The complaint lists the date, time, and location of your first court date. You must appear in court on that day, or you may lose the case automatically. You must also file an appearance and answer. If you are unable to pay the appearance fee, you may qualify to have the fee waived. If there is a criminal case related to the seizure of your property, your case may be set for trial after the criminal case has been resolved. Before trial, the judge may allow discovery, where the State can ask you to respond in writing to questions and give them certain documents, and you can make similar requests of the State. The trial is your opportunity to explain what happened when your property was seized and why you should get the property back.”\n\n\n(4) Forfeiture proceedings under this Article shall be subject to the Code of Civil Procedure and the rules of evidence relating to civil actions shall apply to proceedings under this Article with the following exception. The parties shall be allowed to use, and the court shall receive and consider, all relevant hearsay evidence that relates to evidentiary foundation, chain of custody, business records, recordings, laboratory analysis, laboratory reports, and relevant hearsay related to the use of technology in the investigation that resulted in the seizure of property that is subject to the forfeiture action.\n\n\n(5) Only an owner of or interest holder in the property may file an answer asserting a claim against the property in the action in rem. For purposes of this Section, the owner or interest holder shall be referred to as claimant. Upon motion of the State, the court shall first hold a hearing, in which a claimant shall establish by a preponderance of the evidence, that he or she has a lawful, legitimate ownership interest in the property and that it was obtained through a lawful source.\n\n\n(6) The answer must be signed by the owner or interest holder under penalty of perjury and shall set forth:\n\n\n(A) the caption of the proceedings as set forth on the notice of pending forfeiture and the name of the claimant;\n\n\n(B) the address at which the claimant will accept mail;\n\n\n(C) the nature and extent of the claimant’s interest in the property;\n\n\n(D) the date, identity of transferor, and circumstances of the claimant’s acquisition of the interest in the property;\n\n\n(E) the names and addresses of all other persons known to have an interest in the property;\n\n\n(F) all essential facts supporting each assertion;\n\n\n(G) the precise relief sought; and\n\n\n(H) in a forfeiture action involving currency or its equivalent, a claimant shall provide the State with notice of his or her intent to allege that the currency or its equivalent is not related to the alleged factual basis for the forfeiture, and why.\n\n\nThe answer shall follow the rules under the Code of\n\n\nCivil Procedure.\n\n\n(7) The answer shall be filed with the court within\n\n\n45 days after service of the civil in rem complaint.\n\n\n(8) The hearing shall be held within 60 days after filing of the answer unless continued for good cause.\n\n\n(9) At the judicial in rem proceeding, in the State’s case in chief, the State shall show by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture. If the State makes such a showing, the claimant shall have the burden of production to set forth evidence that the property is not related to the alleged factual basis of the forfeiture. After this production of evidence, the State shall maintain the burden of proof to overcome this assertion. A claimant shall provide the State notice of its intent to allege that the currency or its equivalent is not related to the alleged factual basis of the forfeiture and why. As to conveyances, at the judicial in rem proceeding, in its case in chief, the State shall show by a preponderance of the evidence:\n\n\n(A) that the property is subject to forfeiture; and\n\n\n(B) at least one of the following:\n\n\n(i) that the claimant was legally accountable for the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture;\n\n\n(ii) that the claimant knew or reasonably should have known of the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture;\n\n\n(iii) that the claimant knew or reasonably should have known that the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture was likely to occur;\n\n\n(iv) that the claimant held the property for the benefit of, or as nominee for, any person whose conduct gave rise to its forfeiture;\n\n\n(v) that if the claimant acquired the interest through any person engaging in any of the conduct described above or conduct giving rise to the forfeiture:\n\n\n(a) the claimant did not acquire it as a bona fide purchaser for value; or\n\n\n(b) the claimant acquired the interest under the circumstances that the claimant reasonably should have known the property was derived from, or used in, the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture; or\n\n\n(vi) that the claimant is not the true owner of the property that is subject to forfeiture.\n\n\n(10) If the State does not meet its burden to show that the property is subject to forfeiture, the court shall order the interest in the property returned or conveyed to the claimant and shall order all other property forfeited to the State. If the State does meet its burden to show that the property is subject to forfeiture, the court shall order all property forfeited to the State.\n\n\n(11) A defendant convicted in any criminal proceeding is precluded from later denying the essential allegations of the criminal offense of which the defendant was convicted in any proceeding under this Article regardless of the pendency of an appeal from that conviction. However, evidence of the pendency of an appeal is admissible.\n\n\n(12) On a motion by the parties, the court may stay civil forfeiture proceedings during the criminal trial for a related criminal indictment or information alleging a money laundering violation. Such a stay shall not be available pending an appeal. Property subject to forfeiture under this Article shall not be subject to return or release by a court exercising jurisdiction over a criminal case involving the seizure of the property unless the return or release is consented to by the State’s Attorney.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 100-699, eff. 8-3-18; 100-1163, eff. 12-20-18.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/29B-14)"

Legislative findings.\n\nThe devastating consequences of the barbaric attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001 underscore the compelling need for legislation that is specifically designed to combat the evils of terrorism. Terrorism is inconsistent with civilized society and cannot be tolerated.\n\n\nA comprehensive State law is urgently needed to complement federal laws in the fight against terrorism and to better protect all citizens against terrorist acts. Accordingly, the legislature finds that our laws must be strengthened to ensure that terrorists, as well as those who solicit or provide financial and other support to terrorists, are prosecuted and punished in State courts with appropriate severity. The legislature further finds that due to the grave nature and global reach of terrorism that a comprehensive law encompassing State criminal statutes and strong civil remedies is needed.\n\n\nAn investigation may not be initiated or continued for activities protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, including expressions of support or the provision of financial support for the nonviolent political, religious, philosophical, or ideological goals or beliefs of any person or group.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 92-854, eff. 12-5-02.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/29D-10)"

Boarding or attempting to board an aircraft with weapon.\n\n(a) It is unlawful for any person to board or attempt to board any commercial or charter aircraft, knowingly having in his or her possession any firearm, explosive of any type, or other lethal or dangerous weapon.\n\n\n(b) This Section does not apply to any person authorized by either the federal government or any state government to carry firearms, but the person so exempted from the provisions of this Section shall notify the commander of any aircraft he or she is about to board that he or she does possess a firearm and show identification satisfactory to the aircraft commander that he or she is authorized to carry that firearm.\n\n\n(c) Any person purchasing a ticket to board any commercial or charter aircraft shall by that purchase consent to a search of his or her person or personal belongings by the company selling the ticket to him or her. The person may refuse to submit to a search of his or her person or personal belongings by the aircraft company, but the person refusing may be denied the right to board the commercial or charter aircraft at the discretion of the carrier. Such a refusal creates no inference of unlawful conduct.\n\n\n(d) Any evidence of criminal activity found during a search made pursuant to this Section shall be admissible in legal proceedings for the sole purpose of supporting a charge of violation of this Section and is inadmissible as evidence in any legal proceeding for any other purpose, except in the prosecution of offenses related to weapons as set out in Article 24 of this Code.\n\n\n(e) No action may be brought against any commercial or charter airline company operating in this State for the refusal of that company to permit a person to board any aircraft if that person refused to be searched as set out in subsection (c) of this Section.\n\n\n(f) Violation of this Section is a Class 4 felony.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 96-710, eff. 1-1-10.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/29D-40)"

In such a proceeding, the court shall determine whether a violation has been committed, and shall enter such judgment as it considers necessary to remove the effects of any violation which it finds, and to prevent such violation from continuing or from being renewed in the future. The court, in its discretion, may exercise all powers necessary for this purpose, including, but not limited to, injunction and divestiture of property.\n\n\n(d) Private right of action.

Any action for damages under this subsection is forever barred unless commenced within 4 years after the cause of action accrued. In any action for damages under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, award reasonable fees to the prevailing defendant upon a finding that the plaintiff acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\n\n\n(e) Exclusion from subsequent judicial sales. Any person convicted of a violation of subsection (a) or any similar offense of any state or the United States shall be barred for 5 years from the date of conviction from participating as a bidding entity in any judicial sale.

    "text": "Sec. 33A-1. Legislative intent and definitions.\n\n(a) Legislative findings. The legislature finds and declares the following:\n\n\n(1) The use of a dangerous weapon in the commission of a felony offense poses a much greater threat to the public health, safety, and general welfare, than when a weapon is not used in the commission of the offense.\n\n\n(2) Further, the use of a firearm greatly facilitates the commission of a criminal offense because of the more lethal nature of a firearm and the greater perceived threat produced in those confronted by a person wielding a firearm. Unlike other dangerous weapons such as knives and clubs, the use of a firearm in the commission of a criminal felony offense significantly escalates the threat and the potential for bodily harm, and the greater range of the firearm increases the potential for harm to more persons. Not only are the victims and bystanders at greater risk when a firearm is used, but also the law enforcement officers whose duty is to confront and apprehend the armed suspect.\n\n\n(3) Current law does contain offenses involving the use or discharge of a gun toward or against a person, such as aggravated battery with a firearm, aggravated discharge of a firearm, and reckless discharge of a firearm; however, the General Assembly has legislated greater penalties for the commission of a felony while in possession of a firearm because it deems such acts as more serious.\n\n\n(b) Legislative intent.\n\n\n(1) In order to deter the use of firearms in the commission of a felony offense, the General Assembly deems it appropriate for a greater penalty to be imposed when a firearm is used or discharged in the commission of an offense than the penalty imposed for using other types of weapons and for the penalty to increase on more serious offenses.\n\n\n(2) With the additional elements of the discharge of a firearm and great bodily harm inflicted by a firearm being added to armed violence and other serious felony offenses, it is the intent of the General Assembly to punish those elements more severely during commission of a felony offense than when those elements stand alone as the act of the offender.\n\n\n(3) It is the intent of the 91st General Assembly that should Public Act 88-680 be declared unconstitutional for a violation of Article 4, Section 8 of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois, the amendatory changes made by Public Act 88-680 to Article 33A of the Criminal Code of 1961 and which are set forth as law in this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly are hereby reenacted by this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly.\n\n\n(c) Definitions.\n\n\n(1) “Armed with a dangerous weapon”. A person is considered armed with a dangerous weapon for purposes of this Article, when he or she carries on or about his or her person or is otherwise armed with a Category I, Category II, or Category III weapon.\n\n\n(2) A Category I weapon is a handgun, sawed-off shotgun, sawed-off rifle, any other firearm small enough to be concealed upon the person, semiautomatic firearm, or machine gun. A Category II weapon is any other rifle, shotgun, spring gun, other firearm, stun gun or taser as defined in paragraph (a) of Section 24-1 of this Code, knife with a blade of at least 3 inches in length, dagger, dirk, switchblade knife, stiletto, axe, hatchet, or other deadly or dangerous weapon or instrument of like character. As used in this subsection (b) “semiautomatic firearm” means a repeating firearm that utilizes a portion of the energy of a firing cartridge to extract the fired cartridge case and chamber the next round and that requires a separate pull of the trigger to fire each cartridge.\n\n\n(3) A Category III weapon is a bludgeon, black-jack, slungshot, sand-bag, sand-club, metal knuckles, billy, or other dangerous weapon of like character.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 91-404, eff. 1-1-00; 91-696, eff. 4-13-00.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/33A-2) (from Ch. 38, par. 33A-2)"

Preliminary review.\n\n(a) Within 14 days of the seizure, the State’s Attorney of the county in which the seizure occurred shall seek a preliminary determination from the circuit court as to whether there is probable cause that the property may be subject to forfeiture.\n\n\n(b) The rules of evidence shall not apply to any proceeding conducted under this Section.\n\n\n(c) The court may conduct the review under subsection (a) of this Section simultaneously with a proceeding under Section 109-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 for a related criminal offense if a prosecution is commenced by information or complaint.\n\n\n(d) The court may accept a finding of probable cause at a preliminary hearing following the filing of an information or complaint charging a related criminal offense or following the return of indictment by a grand jury charging the related offense as sufficient evidence of probable cause as required under subsection (a) of this Section.\n\n\n(e) Upon making a finding of probable cause as required under this Section, the circuit court shall order the property subject to the provisions of the applicable forfeiture Act held until the conclusion of any forfeiture proceeding.\n\n\nFor seizures of conveyances, within 28 days of a finding of probable cause under subsection (a) of this Section, the registered owner or other claimant may file a motion in writing supported by sworn affidavits claiming that denial of the use of the conveyance during the pendency of the forfeiture proceedings creates a substantial hardship and alleges facts showing that the hardship was not due to his or her culpable negligence. The court shall consider the following factors in determining whether a substantial hardship has been proven:\n\n\n(1) the nature of the claimed hardship;\n\n\n(2) the availability of public transportation or other available means of transportation; and\n\n\n(3) any available alternatives to alleviate the hardship other than the return of the seized conveyance.\n\n\nIf the court determines that a substantial hardship has been proven, the court shall then balance the nature of the hardship against the State’s interest in safeguarding the conveyance. If the court determines that the hardship outweighs the State’s interest in safeguarding the conveyance, the court may temporarily release the conveyance to the registered owner or the registered owner’s authorized designee, or both, until the conclusion of the forfeiture proceedings or for such shorter period as ordered by the court provided that the person to whom the conveyance is released provides proof of insurance and a valid driver’s license and all State and local registrations for operation of the conveyance are current. The court shall place conditions on the conveyance limiting its use to the stated hardship and providing transportation for employment, religious purposes, medical needs, child care, and restricting the conveyance’s use to only those individuals authorized to use the conveyance by the registered owner. The use of the vehicle shall be further restricted to exclude all recreational and entertainment purposes. The court may order additional restrictions it deems reasonable and just on its own motion or on motion of the People. The court shall revoke the order releasing the conveyance and order that the conveyance be reseized by law enforcement if the conditions of release are violated or if the conveyance is used in the commission of any offense identified in subsection (a) of Section 6-205 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.\n\n\nIf the court orders the release of the conveyance during the pendency of the forfeiture proceedings, the court may order the registered owner or his or her authorized designee to post a cash security with the clerk of the court as ordered by the court. If cash security is ordered, the court shall consider the following factors in determining the amount of the cash security:\n\n\n(A) the full market value of the conveyance;\n\n\n(B) the nature of the hardship;\n\n\n(C) the extent and length of the usage of the conveyance;\n\n\n(D) the ability of the owner or designee to pay; and\n\n\n(E) other conditions as the court deems necessary to safeguard the conveyance.\n\n\nIf the conveyance is released, the court shall order that the registered owner or his or her designee safeguard the conveyance, not remove the conveyance from the jurisdiction, not conceal, destroy, or otherwise dispose of the conveyance, not encumber the conveyance, and not diminish the value of the conveyance in any way. The court shall also make a determination of the full market value of the conveyance prior to it being released based on a source or sources defined in 50 Ill. Adm. Code 919.80(c)(2)(A) or 919.80(c)(2)(B).\n\n\nIf the conveyance subject to forfeiture is released under this Section and is subsequently forfeited, the person to whom the conveyance was released shall return the conveyance to the law enforcement agency that seized the conveyance within 7 days from the date of the declaration of forfeiture or order of forfeiture. If the conveyance is not returned within 7 days, the cash security shall be forfeited in the same manner as the conveyance subject to forfeiture. If the cash security was less than the full market value, a judgment shall be entered against the parties to whom the conveyance was released and the registered owner, jointly and severally, for the difference between the full market value and the amount of the cash security. If the conveyance is returned in a condition other than the condition in which it was released, the cash security shall be returned to the surety who posted the security minus the amount of the diminished value, and that amount shall be forfeited in the same manner as the conveyance subject to forfeiture. Additionally, the court may enter an order allowing any law enforcement agency in the State of Illinois to seize the conveyance wherever it may be found in the State to satisfy the judgment if the cash security was less than the full market value of the conveyance.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 100-512, eff. 7-1-18; 100-699, eff. 8-3-18; 100-1163, eff. 12-20-18.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/36-1a) (from Ch. 38, par. 36-1a)"

This process is also your opportunity to try to prove to a judge that you should get your property back. The complaint lists the date, time, and location of your first court date. You must appear in court on that day, or you may lose the case automatically. You must also file an appearance and answer. If you are unable to pay the appearance fee, you may qualify to have the fee waived. If there is a criminal case related to the seizure of your property, your case may be set for trial after the criminal case has been resolved. Before trial, the judge may allow discovery, where the State can ask you to respond in writing to questions and give them certain documents, and you can make similar requests of the State. The trial is your opportunity to explain what happened when your property was seized and why you should get the property back.”\n\n\n(c) (Blank).\n\n\n(d) (Blank).\n\n\n(e) (Blank).\n\n\n(f) (Blank).\n\n\n(g) (Blank).\n\n\n(h) (Blank).\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 99-78, eff. 7-20-15; 100-512, eff. 7-1-18; 100-699, eff. 8-3-18; 100-1163, eff. 12-20-18.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/36-2.1)"

    "text": "Sec. 48-2. Animal research and production facilities protection.\n\n(a) Definitions.\n\n\n“Animal” means every living creature, domestic or wild, but does not include man.\n\n\n“Animal facility” means any facility engaging in legal scientific research or agricultural production of or involving the use of animals including any organization with a primary purpose of representing livestock production or processing, any organization with a primary purpose of promoting or marketing livestock or livestock products, any person licensed to practice veterinary medicine, any institution as defined in the Impounding and Disposition of Stray Animals Act, and any organization with a primary purpose of representing any such person, organization, or institution. “Animal facility” shall include the owner, operator, and employees of any animal facility and any premises where animals are located.\n\n\n“Director” means the Director of the Illinois\n\n\nDepartment of Agriculture or the Director’s authorized representative.\n\n\n(b) Legislative Declaration. There has been an increasing number of illegal acts committed against animal research and production facilities involving injury or loss of life to humans or animals, criminal trespass and damage to property. These actions not only abridge the property rights of the owner of the facility, they may also damage the public interest by jeopardizing crucial scientific, biomedical, or agricultural research or production. These actions can also threaten the public safety by possibly exposing communities to serious public health concerns and creating traffic hazards. These actions may substantially disrupt or damage publicly funded research and can result in the potential loss of physical and intellectual property. Therefore, it is in the interest of the people of the State of Illinois to protect the welfare of humans and animals as well as productive use of public funds to require regulation to prevent unauthorized possession, alteration, destruction, or transportation of research records, test data, research materials, equipment, research and agricultural production animals.\n\n\n(c) It shall be unlawful for any person:\n\n\n(1) to release, steal, or otherwise intentionally cause the death, injury, or loss of any animal at or from an animal facility and not authorized by that facility;\n\n\n(2) to damage, vandalize, or steal any property in or on an animal facility;\n\n\n(3) to obtain access to an animal facility by false pretenses for the purpose of performing acts not authorized by that facility;\n\n\n(4) to enter into an animal facility with an intent to destroy, alter, duplicate, or obtain unauthorized possession of records, data, materials, equipment, or animals;\n\n\n(5) by theft or deception knowingly to obtain control or to exert control over records, data, material, equipment, or animals of any animal facility for the purpose of depriving the rightful owner or animal facility of the records, material, data, equipment, or animals or for the purpose of concealing, abandoning, or destroying these records, material, data, equipment, or animals; or\n\n\n(6) to enter or remain on an animal facility with the intent to commit an act prohibited under this Section.\n\n\n(d) Sentence.\n\n\n(1) Any person who violates any provision of subsection (c) shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony for each violation, unless the loss, theft, or damage to the animal facility property exceeds $300 in value.\n\n\n(2) If the loss, theft, or damage to the animal facility property exceeds $300 in value but does not exceed $10,000 in value, the person is guilty of a Class 3 felony.\n\n\n(3) If the loss, theft, or damage to the animal facility property exceeds $10,000 in value but does not exceed $100,000 in value, the person is guilty of a Class 2 felony.\n\n\n(4) If the loss, theft, or damage to the animal facility property exceeds $100,000 in value, the person is guilty of a Class 1 felony.\n\n\n(5) Any person who, with the intent that any violation of any provision of subsection (c) be committed, agrees with another to the commission of the violation and commits an act in furtherance of this agreement is guilty of the same class of felony as provided in paragraphs (1) through (4) of this subsection for that violation.\n\n\n(6) Restitution.\n\n\n(A) The court shall conduct a hearing to determine the reasonable cost of replacing materials, data, equipment, animals and records that may have been damaged, destroyed, lost or cannot be returned, and the reasonable cost of repeating any experimentation that may have been interrupted or invalidated as a result of a violation of subsection (c).\n\n\n(B) Any persons convicted of a violation shall be ordered jointly and severally to make restitution to the owner, operator, or both, of the animal facility in the full amount of the reasonable cost determined under paragraph (A).\n\n\n(e) Private right of action. Nothing in this Section shall preclude any animal facility injured in its business or property by a violation of this Section from seeking appropriate relief under any other provision of law or remedy including the issuance of a permanent injunction against any person who violates any provision of this Section. The animal facility owner or operator may petition the court to permanently enjoin the person from violating this Section and the court shall provide this relief.\n\n\n(f) The Director shall have authority to investigate any alleged violation of this Section, along with any other law enforcement agency, and may take any action within the Director’s authority necessary for the enforcement of this Section. State’s Attorneys, State police and other law enforcement officials shall provide any assistance required in the conduct of an investigation and prosecution. Before the Director reports a violation for prosecution he or she may give the owner or operator of the animal facility and the alleged violator an opportunity to present his or her views at an administrative hearing. The Director may adopt any rules and regulations necessary for the enforcement of this Section.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 97-1108, eff. 1-1-13.)\n\n\n(720 ILCS 5/48-3)"

The report shall give the date of theft, description of the vehicle including color, year of manufacture, manufacturer’s trade name, manufacturer’s series name, body style, vehicle identification number and license registration number, including the state in which the license was issued and the year of issuance, together with the name, residence address, business address, and telephone number of the owner. The report shall be routed by the originating law enforcement agency through the Illinois State Police District in which such agency is located.\n\n\n(b) A registered owner or a lienholder may report the theft by conversion of a vehicle, to the Illinois State Police, or any other police department or Sheriff’s office. Such report will be accepted as a report of theft and processed only if a formal complaint is on file and a warrant issued.\n\n\n(c) An operator of a place of business for garaging, repairing, parking or storing vehicles for the public, in which a vehicle remains unclaimed, after being left for the purpose of garaging, repairing, parking or storage, for a period of 15 days, shall, within 5 days after the expiration of that period, report the vehicle as unclaimed to the municipal police when the vehicle is within the corporate limits of any City, Village or incorporated Town, or the County Sheriff, or State Police when the vehicle is outside the corporate limits of a City, Village or incorporated Town. This Section does not apply to any vehicle:\n\n\n(1) removed to a place of storage by a law enforcement agency having jurisdiction, in accordance with Sections 4-201 and 4-203 of this Act; or\n\n\n(2) left under a garaging, repairing, parking, or storage order signed by the owner, lessor, or other legally entitled person.\n\n\nFailure to comply with this Section will result in the forfeiture of storage fees for that vehicle involved. (d) The Illinois State Police shall keep a complete record of all reports filed under this Section of the Act. Upon receipt of such report, a careful search shall be made of the records of the office of the Illinois State Police, and where it is found that a vehicle reported recovered was stolen in a County, City, Village or Town other than the County, City, Village or Town in which it is recovered, the Illinois State Police shall immediately notify the Sheriff, Superintendent of police, Chief of police, or other police officer in command of the Sheriff’s office or Police department of the County, City, Village or Town in which the vehicle was originally reported stolen, giving complete data as to the time and place of recovery.\n\n\n(e) Notification of the theft or conversion of a vehicle will be furnished to the Secretary of State by the Illinois State Police. The Secretary of State shall place the proper information in the license registration and title registration files to indicate the theft or conversion of a motor vehicle or other vehicle. Notification of the recovery of a vehicle previously reported as a theft or a conversion will be furnished to the Secretary of State by the Illinois State Police. The Secretary of State shall remove the proper information from the license registration and title registration files that has previously indicated the theft or conversion of a vehicle. The Secretary of State shall suspend the registration of a vehicle upon receipt of a report from the Illinois State Police that such vehicle was stolen or converted.\n\n\n(f) When the Secretary of State receives an application for a certificate of title or an application for registration of a vehicle and it is determined from the records of the office of the Secretary of State that such vehicle has been reported stolen or converted, the Secretary of State shall immediately notify the Illinois State Police or the Secretary of State Department of Police and shall give the Illinois State Police or the Secretary of State Department of Police the name and address of the person or firm titling or registering the vehicle, together with all other information contained in the application submitted by such person or firm. If the Secretary of State Department of Police receives notification under this subsection (f), it shall conduct an investigation concerning the identity of the registered owner of the stolen or converted vehicle.\n\n\n(g) During the usual course of business the manufacturer of any vehicle shall place an original manufacturer’s vehicle identification number on all such vehicles manufactured and on any part of such vehicles requiring an identification number.\n\n\n(h) Except provided in subsection (h-1), if a manufacturer’s vehicle identification number is missing or has been removed, changed or mutilated on any vehicle, or any part of such vehicle requiring an identification number, the Illinois State Police or the Secretary of State Department of Police shall restore, restamp or reaffix the vehicle identification number plate, or affix a new plate bearing the original manufacturer’s vehicle identification number on each such vehicle and on all necessary parts of the vehicles. A vehicle identification number so affixed, restored, restamped, reaffixed or replaced is not falsified, altered or forged within the meaning of this Act.\n\n\n(h-1) A person engaged in the repair or servicing of vehicles may reaffix a manufacturer’s identification number plate on the same damaged vehicle from which it was originally removed, if the person reaffixes the original manufacturer’s identification number plate in place of the identification number plate affixed on a new dashboard that has been installed in the vehicle. The person must notify the Secretary of State each time the original manufacturer’s identification number plate is reaffixed on a vehicle. The person must keep a record indicating that the identification number plate affixed on the new dashboard has been removed and has been replaced by the manufacturer’s identification number plate originally affixed on the vehicle. The person also must keep a record regarding the status and location of the identification number plate removed from the replacement dashboard. The Secretary shall adopt rules for implementing this subsection (h-1).\n\n\n(h-2) The owner of a vehicle repaired under subsection (h-1) must, within 90 days of the date of the repairs, contact an officer of the Illinois State Police Vehicle Inspection Bureau and arrange for an inspection of the vehicle, by the officer or the officer’s designee, at a mutually agreed upon date and location.\n\n\n(i) If a vehicle or part of any vehicle is found to have the manufacturer’s identification number removed, altered, defaced or destroyed, the vehicle or part shall be seized by any law enforcement agency having jurisdiction and held for the purpose of identification. In the event that the manufacturer’s identification number of a vehicle or part cannot be identified, the vehicle or part shall be considered contraband, and no right of property shall exist in any person owning, leasing or possessing such property, unless the person owning, leasing or possessing the vehicle or part acquired such without knowledge that the manufacturer’s vehicle identification number has been removed, altered, defaced, falsified or destroyed.\n\n\nEither the seizing law enforcement agency or the State’s Attorney of the county where the seizure occurred may make an application for an order of forfeiture to the circuit court in the county of seizure. The application for forfeiture shall be independent from any prosecution arising out of the seizure and is not subject to any final determination of such prosecution. The circuit court shall issue an order forfeiting the property to the seizing law enforcement agency if the court finds that the property did not at the time of seizure possess a valid manufacturer’s identification number and that the original manufacturer’s identification number cannot be ascertained. The seizing law enforcement agency may:\n\n\n(1) retain the forfeited property for official use; or\n\n\n(2) sell the forfeited property and distribute the proceeds in accordance with Section 4-211 of this Code, or dispose of the forfeited property in such manner as the law enforcement agency deems appropriate.\n\n\n(i-1) If a motorcycle is seized under subsection (i), the motorcycle must be returned within 45 days of the date of seizure to the person from whom it was seized, unless (i) criminal charges are pending against that person or (ii) an application for an order of forfeiture has been submitted to the circuit in the county of seizure or (iii) the circuit court in the county of seizure has received from the seizing law enforcement agency and has granted a petition to extend, for a single 30 day period, the 45 days allowed for return of the motorcycle. Except as provided in subsection (i-2), a motorcycle returned to the person from whom it was seized must be returned in essentially the same condition it was in at the time of seizure.\n\n\n(i-2) If any part or parts of a motorcycle seized under subsection (i) are found to be stolen and are removed, the seizing law enforcement agency is not required to replace the part or parts before returning the motorcycle to the person from whom it was seized.\n\n\n(j) The Illinois State Police or the Secretary of State Department of Police shall notify the Secretary of State each time a manufacturer’s vehicle identification number is affixed, reaffixed, restored or restamped on any vehicle. The Secretary of State shall make the necessary changes or corrections in his records, after the proper applications and fees have been submitted, if applicable.\n\n\n(k) Any vessel, vehicle or aircraft used with knowledge and consent of the owner in the commission of, or in the attempt to commit as defined in Section 8-4 of the Criminal Code of 2012, an offense prohibited by Section 4-103 of this Chapter, including transporting of a stolen vehicle or stolen vehicle parts, shall be seized by any law enforcement agency. The seizing law enforcement agency may:\n\n\n(1) return the vehicle to its owner if such vehicle is stolen; or\n\n\n(2) confiscate the vehicle and retain it for any purpose which the law enforcement agency deems appropriate; or\n\n\n(3) sell the vehicle at a public sale or dispose of the vehicle in such other manner as the law enforcement agency deems appropriate.\n\n\nIf the vehicle is sold at public sale, the proceeds of the sale shall be paid to the law enforcement agency. The law enforcement agency shall not retain, sell or dispose of a vehicle under paragraphs (2) or (3) of this subsection (k) except upon an order of forfeiture issued by the circuit court. The circuit court may issue such order of forfeiture upon application of the law enforcement agency or State’s Attorney of the county where the law enforcement agency has jurisdiction, or in the case of the Illinois State Police or the Secretary of State, upon application of the Attorney General.\n\n\nThe court shall issue the order if the owner of the vehicle has been convicted of transporting stolen vehicles or stolen vehicle parts and the evidence establishes that the owner’s vehicle has been used in the commission of such offense.\n\n\nThe provisions of subsection (k) of this Section shall not apply to any vessel, vehicle or aircraft, which has been leased, rented or loaned by its owner, if the owner did not have knowledge of and consent to the use of the vessel, vehicle or aircraft in the commission of, or in an attempt to commit, an offense prohibited by Section 4-103 of this Chapter.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21.)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/4-108) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 4-108)"

Renting motor vehicle to another.\n\n(a) No person shall rent a motor vehicle to any other person unless the latter person, or a driver designated by a nondriver with disabilities and meeting any minimum age and driver’s record requirements that are uniformly applied by the person renting a motor vehicle, is then duly licensed hereunder or, in the case of a nonresident, then duly licensed under the laws of the State or country of his residence unless the State or country of his residence does not require that a driver be licensed.\n\n\n(b) No person shall rent a motor vehicle to another until he has inspected, including through electronic or digital means, the driver’s license of the person to whom the vehicle is to be rented, or by whom it is to be driven, and verified the license is unexpired unless, in the case of a nonresident, the State or country wherein the nonresident resides does not require that a driver be licensed.\n\n\n(c) No person shall rent a motorcycle to another unless the latter person is then duly licensed hereunder as a motorcycle operator, and in the case of a nonresident, then duly licensed under the laws of the State or country of his residence, unless the State or country of his residence does not require that a driver be licensed.\n\n\n(c-1) A rental car company that rents a motor vehicle shall ensure that the renter is provided with an emergency telephone number to personnel capable of fielding roadside assistance and other customer service inquiries, including the ability to provide the caller with the telephone number of the location from which the vehicle was rented, if requested by the caller.

The person must provide, on the request of the renter, based on the available information, an estimated total of the daily rental rate, including all applicable taxes, fees, and other charges, or an estimated total rental charge, based on the return date of the vehicle noted on the rental agreement. Further, if the rental agreement does not already provide an estimated total rental charge, the following statement must be included in the rental agreement:\n\n\n“NOTICE: UNDER ILLINOIS LAW, YOU MAY REQUEST, BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION, AN ESTIMATED TOTAL DAILY RENTAL RATE, INCLUDING TAXES, FEES, AND OTHER CHARGES, OR AN ESTIMATED TOTAL RENTAL CHARGE, BASED ON THE VEHICLE RETURN DATE NOTED ON THIS AGREEMENT.”\n\n\nSuch person shall not charge in addition to the rental rate, taxes, mileage charge, and airport concession charge, if any, any fee which must be paid by the renter as a condition of hiring or leasing the vehicle, such as, but not limited to, required fuel or airport surcharges, nor any fee for transporting the renter to the location where the rented vehicle will be delivered to the renter. In addition to the rental rate, taxes, mileage charge, and airport concession charge, if any, such person may charge for an item or service provided in connection with a particular rental transaction if the renter can avoid incurring the charge by choosing not to obtain or utilize the optional item or service. Items and services for which such person may impose an additional charge include, but are not limited to, optional insurance and accessories requested by the renter, service charges incident to the renter’s optional return of the vehicle to a location other than the location where the vehicle was hired or leased, and charges for refueling the vehicle at the conclusion of the rental transaction in the event the renter did not return the vehicle with as much fuel as was in the fuel tank at the beginning of the rental. “Airport concession charge” means a charge or fee imposed and collected from a renter to reimburse the motor vehicle rental company for the concession fee it is required to pay to a local government corporate authority or airport authority to rent motor vehicles at the airport facility.

Such record may be maintained in an electronic or digital format, and shall be open to inspection by any police officer or designated agent of the Secretary of State. (h) A person licensed as a new car dealer under Section 5-101 of this Code shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section regarding the rental of private passenger motor vehicles when providing, free of charge, temporary substitute vehicles for customers to operate during a period when a customer’s vehicle, which is either leased or owned by that customer, is being repaired, serviced, replaced or otherwise made unavailable to the customer in accordance with an agreement with the licensed new car dealer or vehicle manufacturer, so long as the customer orally or in writing is made aware that the temporary substitute vehicle will be covered by his or her insurance policy and the customer shall only be liable to the extent of any amount deductible from such insurance coverage in accordance with the terms of the policy.\n\n\n(i) This Section, except the requirements of subsection (g), also applies to rental agreements of 30 continuous days or less involving a motor vehicle that was delivered by an out of State person or business to a renter in this State.\n\n\n(j) A public airport may, if approved by its local government corporate authorities or its airport authority, impose a customer facility charge upon customers of rental car companies for the purposes of financing, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining consolidated car rental facilities and common use transportation equipment and facilities, which are used to transport the customer, connecting consolidated car rental facilities with other airport facilities.\n\n\nNotwithstanding subsection (f) of this Section, the customer facility charge shall be collected by the rental car company as a separate charge, and clearly indicated as a separate charge on the rental agreement and invoice. Facility charges shall be immediately deposited into a trust account for the benefit of the airport and remitted at the direction of the airport, but not more often than once per month. The charge shall be uniformly calculated on a per-contract or per-day basis. Facility charges imposed by the airport may not exceed the reasonable costs of financing, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining the consolidated car rental facilities and common use transportation equipment and facilities and may not be used for any other purpose.\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the charges collected under this Section are not subject to retailer occupation, sales, use, or transaction taxes.\n\n\n(k) When a rental car company states a rental rate in any of its rate advertisements, its proprietary computer reservation systems, or its in-person quotations intended to apply to an airport rental, a company that collects from its customers a customer facility charge for that rental under subsection (j) shall do all of the following:\n\n\n(1) Clearly and conspicuously disclose in any radio, television, or other electronic media advertisements the existence and amount of the charge if the advertisement is intended for rentals at an airport imposing the charge or, if the advertisement covers an area with multiple airports with different charges, a range of amounts of customer facility charges if the advertisement is intended for rentals at an airport imposing the charge.\n\n\n(2) Clearly and conspicuously disclose in any print rate advertising the existence and amount of the charge if the advertisement is intended for rentals at an airport imposing the charge or, if the print rate advertisement covers an area with multiple airports with different charges, a range of amounts of customer facility charges if the advertisement is intended for rentals at an airport imposing the charge.\n\n\n(3) Clearly and conspicuously disclose the existence and amount of the charge in any telephonic, in-person, or computer-transmitted quotation from the rental car company’s proprietary computer reservation system at the time of making an initial quotation of a rental rate if the quotation is made by a rental car company location at an airport imposing the charge and at the time of making a reservation of a rental car if the reservation is made by a rental car company location at an airport imposing the charge.\n\n\n(4) Clearly and conspicuously display the charge in any proprietary computer-assisted reservation or transaction directly between the rental car company and the customer, shown or referenced on the same page on the computer screen viewed by the customer as the displayed rental rate and in a print size not smaller than the print size of the rental rate.\n\n\n(5) Clearly and conspicuously disclose and separately identify the existence and amount of the charge on its rental agreement.\n\n\n(6) A rental car company that collects from its customers a customer facility charge under subsection (j) and engages in a practice which does not comply with subsections (f), (j), and (k) commits an unlawful practice within the meaning of the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.\n\n\n(l) Notwithstanding subsection (f), any person who rents a motor vehicle to another may, in connection with the rental of a motor vehicle to (i) a business renter or (ii) a business program sponsor under the sponsor’s business program, do the following:\n\n\n(1) separately quote, by telephone, in person, or by computer transmission, additional charges for the rental; and\n\n\n(2) separately impose additional charges for the rental.\n\n\n(l-5) A person licensed under Section 5-101, 5-101.2, or 5-102 of this Code shall not participate in a rental-purchase agreement vehicle program unless the licensee retains the vehicle in his or her name and retains proof of proper vehicle registration under Chapter 3 of this Code and liability insurance under Section 7-601 of this Code. The licensee shall transfer ownership of the vehicle to the renter within 20 calendar days of the agreed-upon date of completion of the rental-purchase agreement. If the licensee fails to transfer ownership of the vehicle to the renter within the 20 calendar days, then the renter may apply for the vehicle’s title to the Secretary of State by providing the Secretary the rental-purchase agreement, an application for title, the required title fee, and any other documentation the Secretary deems necessary to determine ownership of the vehicle. For purposes of this subsection (l-5), “rental-purchase agreement” has the meaning set forth in Section 1 of the Rental-Purchase Agreement Act. (m) As used in this Section:\n\n\n(1) “Additional charges” means charges other than:\n\n\n(i) a per period base rental rate; (ii) a mileage charge; (iii) taxes; or (iv) a customer facility charge.\n\n\n(2) “Business program” means:\n\n\n(A) a contract between a person who rents motor vehicles and a business program sponsor that establishes rental rates at which the person will rent motor vehicles to persons authorized by the sponsor; or\n\n\n(B) a plan, program, or other arrangement established by a person who rents motor vehicles at the request of, or with the consent of, a business program sponsor under which the person offers to rent motor vehicles to persons authorized by the sponsor on terms that are not the same as those generally offered by the rental company to the public.\n\n\n(3) “Business program sponsor” means any legal entity other than a natural person, including a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, government, municipality or agency, or a natural person operating a business as a sole proprietor.\n\n\n(4) “Business renter” means any person renting a motor vehicle for business purposes or, for any business program sponsor, a person who is authorized by the sponsor to enter into a rental contract under the sponsor’s business program. “Business renter” does not include a person renting as:\n\n\n(A) a non-employee member of a not-for-profit organization;\n\n\n(B) the purchaser of a voucher or other prepaid rental arrangement from a person, including a tour operator, engaged in the business of reselling those vouchers or prepaid rental arrangements to the general public;\n\n\n(C) an individual whose car rental is eligible for reimbursement in whole or in part as a result of the person being insured or provided coverage under a policy of insurance issued by an insurance company; or\n\n\n(D) an individual whose car rental is eligible for reimbursement in whole or in part as a result of the person purchasing motor vehicle repair services from a person licensed to perform those services.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 100-450, eff. 1-1-18; 100-878, eff. 1-1-19; 101-611, eff. 6-1-20 .)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/6-305.1) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 6-305.1)"

The total liability of a renter under subsection (a) for damage to a motor vehicle with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $50,000 or less may not exceed all of the following:\n\n\n(1) The lesser of:\n\n\n(A) Actual and reasonable costs that the person who rents a motor vehicle to another incurred to repair the motor vehicle or that the rental company would have incurred if the motor vehicle had been repaired, which shall reflect any discounts, price reductions, or adjustments available to the rental company; or\n\n\n(B) The fair market value of that motor vehicle immediately before the damage occurred, as determined in the customary market for the retail sale of that motor vehicle; and\n\n\n(2) Actual and reasonable costs incurred by the loss due to theft of the rental motor vehicle up to $2,000; provided, however, that if it is established that the renter or an authorized driver failed to exercise ordinary care while in possession of the vehicle or that the renter or an authorized driver committed or aided and abetted the commission of the theft, then the damages shall be the actual and reasonable costs of the rental vehicle up to its fair market value, as determined by the customary market for the sale of that vehicle.\n\n\nFor purposes of this subsection (b), for the period prior to June 1, 1998, the maximum amount that may be recovered from an authorized driver shall not exceed $6,000; for the period beginning June 1, 1998 through May 31, 1999, the maximum recovery shall not exceed $7,500; and for the period beginning June 1, 1999 through May 31, 2000, the maximum recovery shall not exceed $9,000.

The total liability of a renter under subsection (a) for damage to a motor vehicle with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of more than $50,000 may not exceed all of the following:\n\n\n(1) the lesser of:\n\n\n(A) actual and reasonable costs that the person who rents a motor vehicle to another incurred to repair the motor vehicle or that the rental company would have incurred if the motor vehicle had been repaired, which shall reflect any discounts, price reductions, or adjustments available to the rental company; or\n\n\n(B) the fair market value of that motor vehicle immediately before the damage occurred, as determined in the customary market for the retail sale of that motor vehicle; and\n\n\n(2) the actual and reasonable costs incurred by the loss due to theft of the rental motor vehicle up to $40,000.\n\n\nThe maximum recovery for a motor vehicle with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of more than $50,000 under this subsection (b-5) shall not exceed $40,000 on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly. On October 1, 2016, and for the next 3 years thereafter, the maximum amount that may be recovered from an authorized driver under this subsection (b-5) shall be increased by $2,500 above the prior year’s maximum recovery. On October 1, 2020, and for each year thereafter, the maximum amount that may be recovered from an authorized driver under this subsection (b-5) shall be increased by $1,000 above the prior year’s maximum recovery. (c) Multiple recoveries prohibited. Any person who rents a motor vehicle to another may not hold the renter liable for any amounts that the rental company recovers from any other party.\n\n\n(d) Repair estimates. A person who rents a motor vehicle to another may not collect or attempt to collect the amount described in subsection (b) or (b-5) unless the rental company obtains an estimate from a repair company or an appraiser in the business of providing such appraisals on the costs of repairing the motor vehicle, makes a copy of the estimate available upon request to the renter who may be liable under subsection (a), or the insurer of the renter, and submits a copy of the estimate with any claim to collect the amount described in subsection (b) or (b-5). In order to collect the amount described in subsection (b-5), a person renting a motor vehicle to another must also provide the renter’s personal insurance company with reasonable notice and an opportunity to inspect damages.\n\n\n(d-5) In the event of loss due to theft of the rental motor vehicle with a MSRP more than $50,000, the rental company shall provide reasonable notice of the theft to the renter’s personal insurance company.\n\n\n(e) Duty to mitigate. A claim against a renter resulting from damage or loss to a rental vehicle must be reasonably and rationally related to the actual loss incurred. A rental company shall mitigate damages where possible and shall not assert or collect any claim for physical damage which exceeds the actual costs of the repair, including all discounts or price reductions.\n\n\n(f) No rental company shall require a deposit or an advance charge against the credit card of a renter, in any form, for damages to a vehicle which is in the renter’s possession, custody, or control. No rental company shall require any payment for damage to the rental vehicle, upon the renter’s return of the vehicle in a damaged condition, until after the cost of the damage to the vehicle and liability therefor is agreed to between the rental company and renter or is determined pursuant to law.\n\n\n(g) If insurance coverage exists under the renter’s personal insurance policy and the coverage is confirmed during regular business hours, the renter may require that the rental company must submit any claims to the renter’s personal insurance carrier as the renter’s agent. The rental company shall not make any written or oral representations that it will not present claims or negotiate with the renter’s insurance carrier. For purposes of this Section, confirmation of coverage includes telephone confirmation from insurance company representatives during regular business hours. After confirmation of coverage, the amount of claim shall be resolved between the insurance carrier and the rental company.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 99-201, eff. 10-1-15 .)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/6-305.3)"

    "text": "Sec. 11-208.3. Administrative adjudication of violations of traffic regulations concerning the standing, parking, or condition of vehicles, automated traffic law violations, and automated speed enforcement system violations.\n\n(a) Any municipality or county may provide by ordinance for a system of administrative adjudication of vehicular standing and parking violations and vehicle compliance violations as described in this subsection, automated traffic law violations as defined in Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1, and automated speed enforcement system violations as defined in Section 11-208.8. The administrative system shall have as its purpose the fair and efficient enforcement of municipal or county regulations through the administrative adjudication of automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations and violations of municipal or county ordinances regulating the standing and parking of vehicles, the condition and use of vehicle equipment, and the display of municipal or county wheel tax licenses within the municipality’s or county’s borders. The administrative system shall only have authority to adjudicate civil offenses carrying fines not in excess of $500 or requiring the completion of a traffic education program, or both, that occur after the effective date of the ordinance adopting such a system under this Section. For purposes of this Section, “compliance violation” means a violation of a municipal or county regulation governing the condition or use of equipment on a vehicle or governing the display of a municipal or county wheel tax license.\n\n\n(b) Any ordinance establishing a system of administrative adjudication under this Section shall provide for:\n\n\n(1) A traffic compliance administrator authorized to adopt, distribute, and process parking, compliance, and automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violation notices and other notices required by this Section, collect money paid as fines and penalties for violation of parking and compliance ordinances and automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations, and operate an administrative adjudication system.\n\n\n(2) A parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice that shall specify or include the date, time, and place of violation of a parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulation; the particular regulation violated; any requirement to complete a traffic education program; the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late payment or failure to complete a required traffic education program, or both, when so provided by ordinance; the vehicle make or a photograph of the vehicle; the state registration number of the vehicle; and the identification number of the person issuing the notice. With regard to automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations, vehicle make shall be specified on the automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violation notice if the notice does not include a photograph of the vehicle and the make is available and readily discernible. With regard to municipalities or counties with a population of 1 million or more, it shall be grounds for dismissal of a parking violation if the state registration number or vehicle make specified is incorrect. The violation notice shall state that the completion of any required traffic education program, the payment of any indicated fine, and the payment of any applicable penalty for late payment or failure to complete a required traffic education program, or both, shall operate as a final disposition of the violation. The notice also shall contain information as to the availability of a hearing in which the violation may be contested on its merits. The violation notice shall specify the time and manner in which a hearing may be had.\n\n\n(3) Service of a parking, standing, or compliance violation notice by: (i) affixing the original or a facsimile of the notice to an unlawfully parked or standing vehicle; (ii) handing the notice to the operator of a vehicle if he or she is present; or (iii) mailing the notice to the address of the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle within 30 days after the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner or lessee of the vehicle, but not later than 90 days after the date of the violation, except that in the case of a lessee of a motor vehicle, service of a parking, standing, or compliance violation notice may occur no later than 210 days after the violation; and service of an automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violation notice by mail to the address of the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle within 30 days after the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner or lessee of the vehicle, but not later than 90 days after the violation, except that in the case of a lessee of a motor vehicle, service of an automated traffic law violation notice may occur no later than 210 days after the violation. A person authorized by ordinance to issue and serve parking, standing, and compliance violation notices shall certify as to the correctness of the facts entered on the violation notice by signing his or her name to the notice at the time of service or, in the case of a notice produced by a computerized device, by signing a single certificate to be kept by the traffic compliance administrator attesting to the correctness of all notices produced by the device while it was under his or her control. In the case of an automated traffic law violation, the ordinance shall require a determination by a technician employed or contracted by the municipality or county that, based on inspection of recorded images, the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance. If the technician determines that the vehicle entered the intersection as part of a funeral procession or in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle, a citation shall not be issued. In municipalities with a population of less than 1,000,000 inhabitants and counties with a population of less than 3,000,000 inhabitants, the automated traffic law ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance must be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality or county issuing the violation. In municipalities with a population of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants and counties with a population of 3,000,000 or more inhabitants, the automated traffic law ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance must be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality or county issuing the violation or by an additional fully trained reviewing technician who is not employed by the contractor who employs the technician who made the initial determination. In the case of an automated speed enforcement system violation, the ordinance shall require a determination by a technician employed by the municipality, based upon an inspection of recorded images, video or other documentation, including documentation of the speed limit and automated speed enforcement signage, and documentation of the inspection, calibration, and certification of the speed equipment, that the vehicle was being operated in violation of Article VI of Chapter 11 of this Code or a similar local ordinance. If the technician determines that the vehicle speed was not determined by a calibrated, certified speed equipment device based upon the speed equipment documentation, or if the vehicle was an emergency vehicle, a citation may not be issued. The automated speed enforcement ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a violation occurred be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality issuing the violation or by an additional fully trained reviewing technician who is not employed by the contractor who employs the technician who made the initial determination. Routine and independent calibration of the speeds produced by automated speed enforcement systems and equipment shall be conducted annually by a qualified technician. Speeds produced by an automated speed enforcement system shall be compared with speeds produced by lidar or other independent equipment. Radar or lidar equipment shall undergo an internal validation test no less frequently than once each week. Qualified technicians shall test loop-based equipment no less frequently than once a year. Radar equipment shall be checked for accuracy by a qualified technician when the unit is serviced, when unusual or suspect readings persist, or when deemed necessary by a reviewing technician. Radar equipment shall be checked with the internal frequency generator and the internal circuit test whenever the radar is turned on. Technicians must be alert for any unusual or suspect readings, and if unusual or suspect readings of a radar unit persist, that unit shall immediately be removed from service and not returned to service until it has been checked by a qualified technician and determined to be functioning properly. Documentation of the annual calibration results, including the equipment tested, test date, technician performing the test, and test results, shall be maintained and available for use in the determination of an automated speed enforcement system violation and issuance of a citation. The technician performing the calibration and testing of the automated speed enforcement equipment shall be trained and certified in the use of equipment for speed enforcement purposes. Training on the speed enforcement equipment may be conducted by law enforcement, civilian, or manufacturer’s personnel and if applicable may be equivalent to the equipment use and operations training included in the Speed Measuring Device Operator Program developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The vendor or technician who performs the work shall keep accurate records on each piece of equipment the technician calibrates and tests. As used in this paragraph, “fully trained reviewing technician” means a person who has received at least 40 hours of supervised training in subjects which shall include image inspection and interpretation, the elements necessary to prove a violation, license plate identification, and traffic safety and management. In all municipalities and counties, the automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law ordinance shall require that no additional fee shall be charged to the alleged violator for exercising his or her right to an administrative hearing, and persons shall be given at least 25 days following an administrative hearing to pay any civil penalty imposed by a finding that Section 11-208.6, 11-208.8, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a similar local ordinance has been violated. The original or a facsimile of the violation notice or, in the case of a notice produced by a computerized device, a printed record generated by the device showing the facts entered on the notice, shall be retained by the traffic compliance administrator, and shall be a record kept in the ordinary course of business. A parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice issued, signed, and served in accordance with this Section, a copy of the notice, or the computer-generated record shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts shown on the notice. The notice, copy, or computer-generated record shall be admissible in any subsequent administrative or legal proceedings.\n\n\n(4) An opportunity for a hearing for the registered owner of the vehicle cited in the parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice in which the owner may contest the merits of the alleged violation, and during which formal or technical rules of evidence shall not apply; provided, however, that under Section 11-1306 of this Code the lessee of a vehicle cited in the violation notice likewise shall be provided an opportunity for a hearing of the same kind afforded the registered owner. The hearings shall be recorded, and the person conducting the hearing on behalf of the traffic compliance administrator shall be empowered to administer oaths and to secure by subpoena both the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant books and papers. Persons appearing at a hearing under this Section may be represented by counsel at their expense. The ordinance may also provide for internal administrative review following the decision of the hearing officer.\n\n\n(5) Service of additional notices, sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the registered owner of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary of State or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database, or, under Section 11-1306 or subsection (p) of Section 11-208.6 or 11-208.9, or subsection (p) of Section 11-208.8 of this Code, to the lessee of the cited vehicle at the last address known to the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database. The service shall be deemed complete as of the date of deposit in the United States mail. The notices shall be in the following sequence and shall include, but not be limited to, the information specified herein:\n\n\n(i) A second notice of parking, standing, or compliance violation if the first notice of the violation was issued by affixing the original or a facsimile of the notice to the unlawfully parked vehicle or by handing the notice to the operator. This notice shall specify or include the date and location of the violation cited in the parking, standing, or compliance violation notice, the particular regulation violated, the vehicle make or a photograph of the vehicle, the state registration number of the vehicle, any requirement to complete a traffic education program, the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late payment or failure to complete a traffic education program, or both, when so provided by ordinance, the availability of a hearing in which the violation may be contested on its merits, and the time and manner in which the hearing may be had. The notice of violation shall also state that failure to complete a required traffic education program, to pay the indicated fine and any applicable penalty, or to appear at a hearing on the merits in the time and manner specified, will result in a final determination of violation liability for the cited violation in the amount of the fine or penalty indicated, and that, upon the occurrence of a final determination of violation liability for the failure, and the exhaustion of, or failure to exhaust, available administrative or judicial procedures for review, any incomplete traffic education program or any unpaid fine or penalty, or both, will constitute a debt due and owing the municipality or county.\n\n\n(ii) A notice of final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability. This notice shall be sent following a final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability and the conclusion of judicial review procedures taken under this Section. The notice shall state that the incomplete traffic education program or the unpaid fine or penalty, or both, is a debt due and owing the municipality or county. The notice shall contain warnings that failure to complete any required traffic education program or to pay any fine or penalty due and owing the municipality or county, or both, within the time specified may result in the municipality’s or county’s filing of a petition in the Circuit Court to have the incomplete traffic education program or unpaid fine or penalty, or both, rendered a judgment as provided by this Section, or, where applicable, may result in suspension of the person’s driver’s license for failure to complete a traffic education program.\n\n\n(6) A notice of impending driver’s license suspension. This notice shall be sent to the person liable for failure to complete a required traffic education program. The notice shall state that failure to complete a required traffic education program within 45 days of the notice’s date will result in the municipality or county notifying the Secretary of State that the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings under Section 6-306.5 of this Code. The notice shall also state that the person may obtain a photostatic copy of an original ticket imposing a fine or penalty by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the municipality or county along with a request for the photostatic copy. The notice of impending driver’s license suspension shall be sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address recorded with the Secretary of State or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database.\n\n\n(7) Final determinations of violation liability. A final determination of violation liability shall occur following failure to complete the required traffic education program or to pay the fine or penalty, or both, after a hearing officer’s determination of violation liability and the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust any administrative review procedures provided by ordinance. Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed notice, the hearing officer’s determination of violation liability shall become final: (A) upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination, or (B) upon expiration of the period for filing the petition without a filing having been made.\n\n\n(8) A petition to set aside a determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability that may be filed by a person owing an unpaid fine or penalty. A petition to set aside a determination of liability may also be filed by a person required to complete a traffic education program. The petition shall be filed with and ruled upon by the traffic compliance administrator in the manner and within the time specified by ordinance. The grounds for the petition may be limited to: (A) the person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued, (B) the person having already completed the required traffic education program or paid the fine or penalty, or both, for the violation in question, and (C) excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. With regard to municipalities or counties with a population of 1 million or more, it shall be grounds for dismissal of a parking violation if the state registration number or vehicle make, only if specified in the violation notice, is incorrect. After the determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability has been set aside upon a showing of just cause, the registered owner shall be provided with a hearing on the merits for that violation.\n\n\n(9) Procedures for non-residents. Procedures by which persons who are not residents of the municipality or county may contest the merits of the alleged violation without attending a hearing.\n\n\n(10) A schedule of civil fines for violations of vehicular standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulations enacted by ordinance pursuant to this Section, and a schedule of penalties for late payment of the fines or failure to complete required traffic education programs, provided, however, that the total amount of the fine and penalty for any one violation shall not exceed $250, except as provided in subsection (c) of Section 11-1301.3 of this Code.\n\n\n(11) Other provisions as are necessary and proper to carry into effect the powers granted and purposes stated in this Section.\n\n\n(c) Any municipality or county establishing vehicular standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulations under this Section may also provide by ordinance for a program of vehicle immobilization for the purpose of facilitating enforcement of those regulations. The program of vehicle immobilization shall provide for immobilizing any eligible vehicle upon the public way by presence of a restraint in a manner to prevent operation of the vehicle. Any ordinance establishing a program of vehicle immobilization under this Section shall provide: (1) Criteria for the designation of vehicles eligible for immobilization. A vehicle shall be eligible for immobilization when the registered owner of the vehicle has accumulated the number of incomplete traffic education programs or unpaid final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability, or both, as determined by ordinance.\n\n\n(2) A notice of impending vehicle immobilization and a right to a hearing to challenge the validity of the notice by disproving liability for the incomplete traffic education programs or unpaid final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability, or both, listed on the notice.\n\n\n(3) The right to a prompt hearing after a vehicle has been immobilized or subsequently towed without the completion of the required traffic education program or payment of the outstanding fines and penalties on parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations, or both, for which final determinations have been issued. An order issued after the hearing is a final administrative decision within the meaning of Section 3-101 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n(4) A post immobilization and post-towing notice advising the registered owner of the vehicle of the right to a hearing to challenge the validity of the impoundment.\n\n\n(d) Judicial review of final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations and final administrative decisions issued after hearings regarding vehicle immobilization and impoundment made under this Section shall be subject to the provisions of the Administrative Review Law. (e) Any fine, penalty, incomplete traffic education program, or part of any fine or any penalty remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, administrative remedies created under this Section and the conclusion of any judicial review procedures shall be a debt due and owing the municipality or county and, as such, may be collected in accordance with applicable law. Completion of any required traffic education program and payment in full of any fine or penalty resulting from a standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation shall constitute a final disposition of that violation.\n\n\n(f) After the expiration of the period within which judicial review may be sought for a final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation, the municipality or county may commence a proceeding in the Circuit Court for purposes of obtaining a judgment on the final determination of violation. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a municipality or county from consolidating multiple final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations against a person in a proceeding. Upon commencement of the action, the municipality or county shall file a certified copy or record of the final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation, which shall be accompanied by a certification that recites facts sufficient to show that the final determination of violation was issued in accordance with this Section and the applicable municipal or county ordinance. Service of the summons and a copy of the petition may be by any method provided by Section 2-203 of the Code of Civil Procedure or by certified mail, return receipt requested, provided that the total amount of fines and penalties for final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations does not exceed $2500. If the court is satisfied that the final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation was entered in accordance with the requirements of this Section and the applicable municipal or county ordinance, and that the registered owner or the lessee, as the case may be, had an opportunity for an administrative hearing and for judicial review as provided in this Section, the court shall render judgment in favor of the municipality or county and against the registered owner or the lessee for the amount indicated in the final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation, plus costs. The judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced in the same manner as other judgments for the recovery of money.\n\n\n(g) The fee for participating in a traffic education program under this Section shall not exceed $25.\n\n\nA low-income individual required to complete a traffic education program under this Section who provides proof of eligibility for the federal earned income tax credit under Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code or the Illinois earned income tax credit under Section 212 of the Illinois Income Tax Act shall not be required to pay any fee for participating in a required traffic education program.\n\n\n(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a person shall not be liable for violations, fees, fines, or penalties under this Section during the period in which the motor vehicle was stolen or hijacked, as indicated in a report to the appropriate law enforcement agency filed in a timely manner.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-32, eff. 6-28-19; 101-623, eff. 7-1-20; 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-905, eff. 1-1-23 .)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-208.4)"

    "text": "Sec. 11-208.6. Automated traffic law enforcement system.\n\n(a) As used in this Section, “automated traffic law enforcement system” means a device with one or more motor vehicle sensors working in conjunction with a red light signal to produce recorded images of motor vehicles entering an intersection against a red signal indication in violation of Section 11-306 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance.\n\n\nAn automated traffic law enforcement system is a system, in a municipality or county operated by a governmental agency, that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle’s violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance and is designed to obtain a clear recorded image of the vehicle and the vehicle’s license plate. The recorded image must also display the time, date, and location of the violation.\n\n\n(b) As used in this Section, “recorded images” means images recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system on:\n\n\n(1) 2 or more photographs;\n\n\n(2) 2 or more microphotographs;\n\n\n(3) 2 or more electronic images; or\n\n\n(4) a video recording showing the motor vehicle and, on at least one image or portion of the recording, clearly identifying the registration plate or digital registration plate number of the motor vehicle.\n\n\n(b-5) A municipality or county that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle’s violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance must make the recorded images of a violation accessible to the alleged violator by providing the alleged violator with a website address, accessible through the Internet. (c) Except as provided under Section 11-208.8 of this Code, a county or municipality, including a home rule county or municipality, may not use an automated traffic law enforcement system to provide recorded images of a motor vehicle for the purpose of recording its speed. Except as provided under Section 11-208.8 of this Code, the regulation of the use of automated traffic law enforcement systems to record vehicle speeds is an exclusive power and function of the State. This subsection (c) is a denial and limitation of home rule powers and functions under subsection (h) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution.\n\n\n(c-5) A county or municipality, including a home rule county or municipality, may not use an automated traffic law enforcement system to issue violations in instances where the motor vehicle comes to a complete stop and does not enter the intersection, as defined by Section 1-132 of this Code, during the cycle of the red signal indication unless one or more pedestrians or bicyclists are present, even if the motor vehicle stops at a point past a stop line or crosswalk where a driver is required to stop, as specified in subsection (c) of Section 11-306 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance.\n\n\n(c-6) A county, or a municipality with less than 2,000,000 inhabitants, including a home rule county or municipality, may not use an automated traffic law enforcement system to issue violations in instances where a motorcyclist enters an intersection against a red signal indication when the red signal fails to change to a green signal within a reasonable period of time not less than 120 seconds because of a signal malfunction or because the signal has failed to detect the arrival of the motorcycle due to the motorcycle’s size or weight.\n\n\n(d) For each violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance recorded by an automatic traffic law enforcement system, the county or municipality having jurisdiction shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered owner of the vehicle as the alleged violator. The notice shall be delivered to the registered owner of the vehicle, by mail, within 30 days after the Secretary of State notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner of the vehicle, but in no event later than 90 days after the violation.\n\n\nThe notice shall include:\n\n\n(1) the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle;\n\n\n(2) the registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the violation;\n\n\n(3) the violation charged; (4) the location where the violation occurred;\n\n\n(5) the date and time of the violation;\n\n\n(6) a copy of the recorded images;\n\n\n(7) the amount of the civil penalty imposed and the requirements of any traffic education program imposed and the date by which the civil penalty should be paid and the traffic education program should be completed;\n\n\n(8) a statement that recorded images are evidence of a violation of a red light signal;\n\n\n(9) a warning that failure to pay the civil penalty, to complete a required traffic education program, or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability;\n\n\n(10) a statement that the person may elect to proceed by:\n\n\n(A) paying the fine, completing a required traffic education program, or both; or\n\n\n(B) challenging the charge in court, by mail, or by administrative hearing; and\n\n\n(11) a website address, accessible through the Internet, where the person may view the recorded images of the violation.\n\n\n(e) (Blank).\n\n\n(f) Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated traffic law enforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be evidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation under this Section.\n\n\n(g) Recorded images made by an automatic traffic law enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation.\n\n\n(h) The court or hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation:\n\n\n(1) that the motor vehicle or registration plates or digital registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation;\n\n\n(2) that the driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection when the light was red either (i) in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or (ii) as part of a funeral procession; and\n\n\n(3) any other evidence or issues provided by municipal or county ordinance.\n\n\n(i) To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates or digital registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner. (j) Unless the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer at the time of the violation, the motor vehicle owner is subject to a civil penalty not exceeding $100 or the completion of a traffic education program, or both, plus an additional penalty of not more than $100 for failure to pay the original penalty or to complete a required traffic education program, or both, in a timely manner, if the motor vehicle is recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system. A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this Section is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of the vehicle.\n\n\n(j-3) A registered owner who is a holder of a valid commercial driver’s license is not required to complete a traffic education program.\n\n\n(j-5) For purposes of the required traffic education program only, a registered owner may submit an affidavit to the court or hearing officer swearing that at the time of the alleged violation, the vehicle was in the custody and control of another person. The affidavit must identify the person in custody and control of the vehicle, including the person’s name and current address. The person in custody and control of the vehicle at the time of the violation is required to complete the required traffic education program. If the person in custody and control of the vehicle at the time of the violation completes the required traffic education program, the registered owner of the vehicle is not required to complete a traffic education program.\n\n\n(k) An intersection equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must be posted with a sign visible to approaching traffic indicating that the intersection is being monitored by an automated traffic law enforcement system.\n\n\n(k-3) A municipality or county that has one or more intersections equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must provide notice to drivers by posting the locations of automated traffic law systems on the municipality or county website.\n\n\n(k-5) An intersection equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must have a yellow change interval that conforms with the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (IMUTCD) published by the Illinois Department of Transportation.\n\n\n(k-7) A municipality or county operating an automated traffic law enforcement system shall conduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact of each automated traffic law enforcement system at an intersection following installation of the system. The statistical analysis shall be based upon the best available crash, traffic, and other data, and shall cover a period of time before and after installation of the system sufficient to provide a statistically valid comparison of safety impact. The statistical analysis shall be consistent with professional judgment and acceptable industry practice. The statistical analysis also shall be consistent with the data required for valid comparisons of before and after conditions and shall be conducted within a reasonable period following the installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The statistical analysis required by this subsection (k-7) shall be made available to the public and shall be published on the website of the municipality or county. If the statistical analysis for the 36 month period following installation of the system indicates that there has been an increase in the rate of crashes at the approach to the intersection monitored by the system, the municipality or county shall undertake additional studies to determine the cause and severity of the crashes, and may take any action that it determines is necessary or appropriate to reduce the number or severity of the crashes at that intersection.\n\n\n(l) The compensation paid for an automated traffic law enforcement system must be based on the value of the equipment or the services provided and may not be based on the number of traffic citations issued or the revenue generated by the system.\n\n\n(m) This Section applies only to the counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, Madison, McHenry, St. Clair, and Will and to municipalities located within those counties.\n\n\n(n) The fee for participating in a traffic education program under this Section shall not exceed $25.\n\n\nA low-income individual required to complete a traffic education program under this Section who provides proof of eligibility for the federal earned income tax credit under Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code or the Illinois earned income tax credit under Section 212 of the Illinois Income Tax Act shall not be required to pay any fee for participating in a required traffic education program.\n\n\n(o) (Blank).\n\n\n(p) No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a written lease agreement shall be liable for an automated speed or traffic law enforcement system violation involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease; provided that upon the request of the appropriate authority received within 120 days after the violation occurred, the lessor provides within 60 days after such receipt the name and address of the lessee.\n\n\nUpon the provision of information by the lessor pursuant to this subsection, the county or municipality may issue the violation to the lessee of the vehicle in the same manner as it would issue a violation to a registered owner of a vehicle pursuant to this Section, and the lessee may be held liable for the violation.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-395, eff. 8-16-19; 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-982, eff. 7-1-23.)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-208.7)"

    "text": "Sec. 11-208.8. Automated speed enforcement systems in safety zones.\n\n(a) As used in this Section:\n\n\n“Automated speed enforcement system” means a photographic device, radar device, laser device, or other electrical or mechanical device or devices installed or utilized in a safety zone and designed to record the speed of a vehicle and obtain a clear photograph or other recorded image of the vehicle and the vehicle’s registration plate or digital registration plate while the driver is violating Article VI of Chapter 11 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance.\n\n\nAn automated speed enforcement system is a system, located in a safety zone which is under the jurisdiction of a municipality, that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle’s violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance and is designed to obtain a clear recorded image of the vehicle and the vehicle’s license plate. The recorded image must also display the time, date, and location of the violation.\n\n\n“Owner” means the person or entity to whom the vehicle is registered.\n\n\n“Recorded image” means images recorded by an automated speed enforcement system on:\n\n\n(1) 2 or more photographs;\n\n\n(2) 2 or more microphotographs;\n\n\n(3) 2 or more electronic images; or\n\n\n(4) a video recording showing the motor vehicle and, on at least one image or portion of the recording, clearly identifying the registration plate or digital registration plate number of the motor vehicle.\n\n\n“Safety zone” means an area that is within one-eighth of a mile from the nearest property line of any public or private elementary or secondary school, or from the nearest property line of any facility, area, or land owned by a school district that is used for educational purposes approved by the Illinois State Board of Education, not including school district headquarters or administrative buildings. A safety zone also includes an area that is within one-eighth of a mile from the nearest property line of any facility, area, or land owned by a park district used for recreational purposes. However, if any portion of a roadway is within either one-eighth mile radius, the safety zone also shall include the roadway extended to the furthest portion of the next furthest intersection. The term “safety zone” does not include any portion of the roadway known as Lake Shore Drive or any controlled access highway with 8 or more lanes of traffic. (a-5) The automated speed enforcement system shall be operational and violations shall be recorded only at the following times:\n\n\n(i) if the safety zone is based upon the property line of any facility, area, or land owned by a school district, only on school days and no earlier than 6 a.m. and no later than 8:30 p.m. if the school day is during the period of Monday through Thursday, or 9 p.m. if the school day is a Friday; and\n\n\n(ii) if the safety zone is based upon the property line of any facility, area, or land owned by a park district, no earlier than one hour prior to the time that the facility, area, or land is open to the public or other patrons, and no later than one hour after the facility, area, or land is closed to the public or other patrons.\n\n\n(b) A municipality that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle’s violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance must make the recorded images of a violation accessible to the alleged violator by providing the alleged violator with a website address, accessible through the Internet. (c) Notwithstanding any penalties for any other violations of this Code, the owner of a motor vehicle used in a traffic violation recorded by an automated speed enforcement system shall be subject to the following penalties:\n\n\n(1) if the recorded speed is no less than 6 miles per hour and no more than 10 miles per hour over the legal speed limit, a civil penalty not exceeding $50, plus an additional penalty of not more than $50 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely manner; or\n\n\n(2) if the recorded speed is more than 10 miles per hour over the legal speed limit, a civil penalty not exceeding $100, plus an additional penalty of not more than $100 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely manner.\n\n\nA penalty may not be imposed under this Section if the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer for a speeding violation occurring within one-eighth of a mile and 15 minutes of the violation that was recorded by the system. A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this Section is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of the vehicle. A law enforcement officer is not required to be present or to witness the violation. No penalty may be imposed under this Section if the recorded speed of a vehicle is 5 miles per hour or less over the legal speed limit. The municipality may send, in the same manner that notices are sent under this Section, a speed violation warning notice where the violation involves a speed of 5 miles per hour or less above the legal speed limit. (d) The net proceeds that a municipality receives from civil penalties imposed under an automated speed enforcement system, after deducting all non-personnel and personnel costs associated with the operation and maintenance of such system, shall be expended or obligated by the municipality for the following purposes:\n\n\n(i) public safety initiatives to ensure safe passage around schools, and to provide police protection and surveillance around schools and parks, including but not limited to: (1) personnel costs; and (2) non-personnel costs such as construction and maintenance of public safety infrastructure and equipment;\n\n\n(ii) initiatives to improve pedestrian and traffic safety;\n\n\n(iii) construction and maintenance of infrastructure within the municipality, including but not limited to roads and bridges; and\n\n\n(iv) after school programs. (e) For each violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance recorded by an automated speed enforcement system, the municipality having jurisdiction shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered owner of the vehicle as the alleged violator. The notice shall be delivered to the registered owner of the vehicle, by mail, within 30 days after the Secretary of State notifies the municipality of the identity of the owner of the vehicle, but in no event later than 90 days after the violation.\n\n\n(f) The notice required under subsection (e) of this Section shall include:\n\n\n(1) the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle;\n\n\n(2) the registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the violation;\n\n\n(3) the violation charged; (4) the date, time, and location where the violation occurred;\n\n\n(5) a copy of the recorded image or images; (6) the amount of the civil penalty imposed and the date by which the civil penalty should be paid;\n\n\n(7) a statement that recorded images are evidence of a violation of a speed restriction;\n\n\n(8) a warning that failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability;\n\n\n(9) a statement that the person may elect to proceed by:\n\n\n(A) paying the fine; or (B) challenging the charge in court, by mail, or by administrative hearing; and\n\n\n(10) a website address, accessible through the Internet, where the person may view the recorded images of the violation.\n\n\n(g) (Blank).\n\n\n(h) Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated speed enforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be evidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation under this Section.\n\n\n(i) Recorded images made by an automated speed enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation.\n\n\n(j) The court or hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation:\n\n\n(1) that the motor vehicle or registration plates or digital registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control or in the possession of the owner or lessee at the time of the violation;\n\n\n(1.5) that the motor vehicle was hijacked before the violation occurred and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner or lessee at the time of the violation;\n\n\n(2) that the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer for a speeding violation occurring within one-eighth of a mile and 15 minutes of the violation that was recorded by the system; and\n\n\n(3) any other evidence or issues provided by municipal ordinance.\n\n\n(k) To demonstrate that the motor vehicle was hijacked or the motor vehicle or registration plates or digital registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner or lessee at the time of the violation, the owner or lessee must submit proof that a report concerning the motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner. (l) A roadway equipped with an automated speed enforcement system shall be posted with a sign conforming to the national Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices that is visible to approaching traffic stating that vehicle speeds are being photo-enforced and indicating the speed limit. The municipality shall install such additional signage as it determines is necessary to give reasonable notice to drivers as to where automated speed enforcement systems are installed.\n\n\n(m) A roadway where a new automated speed enforcement system is installed shall be posted with signs providing 30 days notice of the use of a new automated speed enforcement system prior to the issuance of any citations through the automated speed enforcement system.\n\n\n(n) The compensation paid for an automated speed enforcement system must be based on the value of the equipment or the services provided and may not be based on the number of traffic citations issued or the revenue generated by the system.\n\n\n(o) (Blank).\n\n\n(p) No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a written lease agreement shall be liable for an automated speed or traffic law enforcement system violation involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease; provided that upon the request of the appropriate authority received within 120 days after the violation occurred, the lessor provides within 60 days after such receipt the name and address of the lessee. The drivers license number of a lessee may be subsequently individually requested by the appropriate authority if needed for enforcement of this Section.\n\n\nUpon the provision of information by the lessor pursuant to this subsection, the municipality may issue the violation to the lessee of the vehicle in the same manner as it would issue a violation to a registered owner of a vehicle pursuant to this Section, and the lessee may be held liable for the violation.\n\n\n(q) A municipality using an automated speed enforcement system must provide notice to drivers by publishing the locations of all safety zones where system equipment is installed on the website of the municipality.\n\n\n(r) A municipality operating an automated speed enforcement system shall conduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact of the system. The statistical analysis shall be based upon the best available crash, traffic, and other data, and shall cover a period of time before and after installation of the system sufficient to provide a statistically valid comparison of safety impact. The statistical analysis shall be consistent with professional judgment and acceptable industry practice. The statistical analysis also shall be consistent with the data required for valid comparisons of before and after conditions and shall be conducted within a reasonable period following the installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The statistical analysis required by this subsection shall be made available to the public and shall be published on the website of the municipality.\n\n\n(s) This Section applies only to municipalities with a population of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-395, eff. 8-16-19; 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-905, eff. 1-1-23 .)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-208.9)\n\n(Text of Section from P.A. 102-982)"

Automated traffic law enforcement system; approaching, overtaking, and passing a school bus.\n\n(a) As used in this Section, “automated traffic law enforcement system” means a device with one or more motor vehicle sensors working in conjunction with the visual signals on a school bus, as specified in Sections 12-803 and 12-805 of this Code, to produce recorded images of motor vehicles that fail to stop before meeting or overtaking, from either direction, any school bus stopped at any location for the purpose of receiving or discharging pupils in violation of Section 11-1414 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance.\n\n\nAn automated traffic law enforcement system is a system, in a municipality or county operated by a governmental agency, that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle’s violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance and is designed to obtain a clear recorded image of the vehicle and the vehicle’s license plate. The recorded image must also display the time, date, and location of the violation.\n\n\n(b) As used in this Section, “recorded images” means images recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system on:\n\n\n(1) 2 or more photographs;\n\n\n(2) 2 or more microphotographs;\n\n\n(3) 2 or more electronic images; or\n\n\n(4) a video recording showing the motor vehicle and, on at least one image or portion of the recording, clearly identifying the registration plate or digital registration plate number of the motor vehicle.\n\n\n(c) A municipality or county that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle’s violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance must make the recorded images of a violation accessible to the alleged violator by providing the alleged violator with a website address, accessible through the Internet. (d) For each violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system, the county or municipality having jurisdiction shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered owner of the vehicle as the alleged violator. The notice shall be delivered to the registered owner of the vehicle, by mail, within 30 days after the Secretary of State notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner of the vehicle, but in no event later than 90 days after the violation.\n\n\n(e) The notice required under subsection (d) shall include:\n\n\n(1) the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle;\n\n\n(2) the registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the violation;\n\n\n(3) the violation charged; (4) the location where the violation occurred;\n\n\n(5) the date and time of the violation;\n\n\n(6) a copy of the recorded images;\n\n\n(7) the amount of the civil penalty imposed and the date by which the civil penalty should be paid;\n\n\n(8) a statement that recorded images are evidence of a violation of overtaking or passing a school bus stopped for the purpose of receiving or discharging pupils;\n\n\n(9) a warning that failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability;\n\n\n(10) a statement that the person may elect to proceed by:\n\n\n(A) paying the fine; or (B) challenging the charge in court, by mail, or by administrative hearing; and\n\n\n(11) a website address, accessible through the Internet, where the person may view the recorded images of the violation.\n\n\n(f) (Blank).\n\n\n(g) Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated traffic law enforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be evidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation under this Section.\n\n\n(h) Recorded images made by an automated traffic law enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation.\n\n\n(i) The court or hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation:\n\n\n(1) that the motor vehicle or registration plates or digital registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation;\n\n\n(2) that the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer for a violation of Section 11-1414 of this Code within one-eighth of a mile and 15 minutes of the violation that was recorded by the system;\n\n\n(3) that the visual signals required by Sections 12-803 and 12-805 of this Code were damaged, not activated, not present in violation of Sections 12-803 and 12-805, or inoperable; and\n\n\n(4) any other evidence or issues provided by municipal or county ordinance.\n\n\n(j) To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates or digital registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner. (k) Unless the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer at the time of the violation, the motor vehicle owner is subject to a civil penalty not exceeding $150 for a first time violation or $500 for a second or subsequent violation, plus an additional penalty of not more than $100 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely manner, if the motor vehicle is recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system. A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this Section is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of the vehicle, but may be recorded by the municipality or county for the purpose of determining if a person is subject to the higher fine for a second or subsequent offense.\n\n\n(l) A school bus equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must be posted with a sign indicating that the school bus is being monitored by an automated traffic law enforcement system.\n\n\n(m) A municipality or county that has one or more school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must provide notice to drivers by posting a list of school districts using school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system on the municipality or county website. School districts that have one or more school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must provide notice to drivers by posting that information on their websites.\n\n\n(n) A municipality or county operating an automated traffic law enforcement system shall conduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact in each school district using school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system following installation of the system. The statistical analysis shall be based upon the best available crash, traffic, and other data, and shall cover a period of time before and after installation of the system sufficient to provide a statistically valid comparison of safety impact. The statistical analysis shall be consistent with professional judgment and acceptable industry practice. The statistical analysis also shall be consistent with the data required for valid comparisons of before and after conditions and shall be conducted within a reasonable period following the installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The statistical analysis required by this subsection shall be made available to the public and shall be published on the website of the municipality or county. If the statistical analysis for the 36-month period following installation of the system indicates that there has been an increase in the rate of crashes at the approach to school buses monitored by the system, the municipality or county shall undertake additional studies to determine the cause and severity of the crashes, and may take any action that it determines is necessary or appropriate to reduce the number or severity of the crashes involving school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system.\n\n\n(o) The compensation paid for an automated traffic law enforcement system must be based on the value of the equipment or the services provided and may not be based on the number of traffic citations issued or the revenue generated by the system.\n\n\n(p) No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a written lease agreement shall be liable for an automated speed or traffic law enforcement system violation involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease; provided that upon the request of the appropriate authority received within 120 days after the violation occurred, the lessor provides within 60 days after such receipt the name and address of the lessee.\n\n\nUpon the provision of information by the lessor pursuant to this subsection, the county or municipality may issue the violation to the lessee of the vehicle in the same manner as it would issue a violation to a registered owner of a vehicle pursuant to this Section, and the lessee may be held liable for the violation.\n\n\n(q) (Blank).\n\n\n(r) After a municipality or county enacts an ordinance providing for automated traffic law enforcement systems under this Section, each school district within that municipality or county’s jurisdiction may implement an automated traffic law enforcement system under this Section. The elected school board for that district must approve the implementation of an automated traffic law enforcement system. The school district shall be responsible for entering into a contract, approved by the elected school board of that district, with vendors for the installation, maintenance, and operation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The school district must enter into an intergovernmental agreement, approved by the elected school board of that district, with the municipality or county with jurisdiction over that school district for the administration of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The proceeds from a school district’s automated traffic law enforcement system’s fines shall be divided equally between the school district and the municipality or county administering the automated traffic law enforcement system.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-395, eff. 8-16-19; 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-982, eff. 7-1-23.)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-209) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 11-209)"

Notwithstanding Section 1-126 and Section 1-201 of this Code, if the local authority grants such request by the adoption of an enabling ordinance then all such private streets or roads shall be considered \"highways\" only for the enforcement purposes of this Code.\n\n(b) All regulations adopted and traffic control devices employed by a local authority in the enforcement of this Code on such streets or roads within any private area, pursuant to this Section, shall be consistent with the provisions of this Code and shall conform to the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.\n\n\nA local authority may require that any person who files a request for the installation of traffic signs pay for the cost of such traffic signs. Such traffic signs shall be in conformity with Section 11-604 of this Code.\n\n\n(c) Any person or board of directors which has filed such a request under this Section, may rescind that request by filing with the appropriate local authority a written request for such rescission. Upon receipt of the written request, the local authority shall subsequently repeal the original enabling ordinance. Such repeal shall not take effect until the first day of January following any such action by the local authorities. However, no such rescission request may be filed within 12 months of the date of the original written request.\n\n\n(d) The filing of a written request or the adoption of the enabling ordinance under this Section in no way constitutes a dedication to public use of any street, road, driveway, trail, terrace, bridle path, parkway, parking area, or other roadway open to or used by vehicular traffic, nor does it prevent such person or board of directors, as owners of such property, from requiring additional regulations than those specified by the local authorities or otherwise regulating such use as may seem best to such person or board of directors as long as they do not conflict with the powers granted to local authorities under Section 11-208 of this Code.\n\n\n(e) This amendatory act of 1972 is not a prohibition upon the contractual and associational powers granted by Article VII, Section 10 of the Illinois Constitution.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 86-521.)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-210) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 11-210)"

This limitation shall not apply to the taking of breath, other bodily substance, or urine specimens.\n\n\nWhen a blood test of a person who has been taken to an adjoining state for medical treatment is requested by an Illinois law enforcement officer, the blood may be withdrawn only by a physician authorized to practice medicine in the adjoining state, a licensed physician assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, a registered nurse, a trained phlebotomist acting under the direction of the physician, or licensed paramedic. The law enforcement officer requesting the test shall take custody of the blood sample, and the blood sample shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the Illinois State Police for that purpose.\n\n\n(3) The person tested may have a physician, or a qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of their own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.\n\n\n(4) Upon the request of the person who shall submit to a chemical test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or such person’s attorney.\n\n\n(5) Alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.\n\n\n(6) Tetrahydrocannabinol concentration means either 5 nanograms or more of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter of other bodily substance.\n\n\n(a-5) Law enforcement officials may use validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration when conducting investigations of a violation of Section 11-501 or similar local ordinance by drivers suspected of driving under the influence of cannabis. The General Assembly finds that (i) validated roadside chemical tests are effective means to determine if a person is under the influence of cannabis and (ii) standardized field sobriety tests approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are divided attention tasks that are intended to determine if a person is under the influence of cannabis. The purpose of these tests is to determine the effect of the use of cannabis on a person’s capacity to think and act with ordinary care and therefore operate a motor vehicle safely. Therefore, the results of these validated roadside chemical tests and standardized field sobriety tests, appropriately administered, shall be admissible in the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of an arrest for a cannabis-related offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a similar local ordinance or proceedings under Section 2-118.1 or 2-118.2. Where a test is made the following provisions shall apply:\n\n\n(1) The person tested may have a physician, or a qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of their own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to the standardized field sobriety test or tests administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person does not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.\n\n\n(2) Upon the request of the person who shall submit to validated roadside chemical tests or a standardized field sobriety test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney.\n\n\n(3) At the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of an arrest for an offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a similar local ordinance or proceedings under Section 2-118.1 or 2-118.2 in which the results of these validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests are admitted, the person may present and the trier of fact may consider evidence that the person lacked the physical capacity to perform the validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests.\n\n\n(b) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in the person’s blood or breath at the time alleged as shown by analysis of the person’s blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance shall give rise to the following presumptions:\n\n\n(1) If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.05 or less, it shall be presumed that the person was not under the influence of alcohol.\n\n\n(2) If there was at that time an alcohol concentration in excess of 0.05 but less than 0.08, such facts shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol, but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.\n\n\n(3) If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of alcohol.\n\n\n(4) The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of any other relevant evidence bearing upon the question whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.\n\n\n(b-5) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, intoxicating compound or compounds or any combination thereof, the concentration of cannabis in the person’s whole blood or other bodily substance at the time alleged as shown by analysis of the person’s blood or other bodily substance shall give rise to the following presumptions:\n\n\n(1) If there was a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of 5 nanograms or more in whole blood or 10 nanograms or more in an other bodily substance as defined in this Section, it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of cannabis.\n\n\n(2) If there was at that time a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of less than 5 nanograms in whole blood or less than 10 nanograms in an other bodily substance, such facts shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of cannabis, but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of cannabis.\n\n\n(c)(1) If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test under the provisions of Section 11-501.1, evidence of refusal shall be admissible in any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination thereof was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle.\n\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any ability to refuse under this Code to submit to these tests or any ability to revoke the implied consent to these tests, if a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle driven by or in actual physical control of a person under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination thereof has caused the death or personal injury to another, the law enforcement officer shall request, and that person shall submit, upon the request of a law enforcement officer, to a chemical test or tests of his or her blood, breath, other bodily substance, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol content thereof or the presence of any other drug or combination of both.\n\n\nThis provision does not affect the applicability of or imposition of driver’s license sanctions under Section 11-501.1 of this Code.\n\n\n(3) For purposes of this Section, a personal injury includes any Type A injury as indicated on the traffic crash report completed by a law enforcement officer that requires immediate professional attention in either a doctor’s office or a medical facility. A Type A injury includes severe bleeding wounds, distorted extremities, and injuries that require the injured party to be carried from the scene.\n\n\n(d) If a person refuses validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests under Section 11-501.9 of this Code, evidence of refusal shall be admissible in any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts committed while the person was driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle and alleged to have been impaired by the use of cannabis.\n\n\n(e) Illinois State Police compliance with the changes in this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly concerning testing of other bodily substances and tetrahydrocannabinol concentration by Illinois State Police laboratories is subject to appropriation and until the Illinois State Police adopt standards and completion validation. Any laboratories that test for the presence of cannabis or other drugs under this Article, the Snowmobile Registration and Safety Act, or the Boat Registration and Safety Act must comply with ISO/IEC 17025:2005.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-27, eff. 6-25-19; 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 102-982, eff. 7-1-23.)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-501.4) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 11-501.4)"

Preliminary Breath Screening Test.\n\n(a) If a law enforcement officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that a person is violating or has violated Section 11-501 or a similar provision of a local ordinance, the officer, prior to an arrest, may request the person to provide a sample of his or her breath for a preliminary breath screening test using a portable device approved by the Illinois State Police. The person may refuse the test. The results of this preliminary breath screening test may be used by the law enforcement officer for the purpose of assisting with the determination of whether to require a chemical test as authorized under Sections 11-501.1 and 11-501.2, and the appropriate type of test to request. Any chemical test authorized under Sections 11-501.1 and 11-501.2 may be requested by the officer regardless of the result of the preliminary breath screening test, if probable cause for an arrest exists. The result of a preliminary breath screening test may be used by the defendant as evidence in any administrative or court proceeding involving a violation of Section 11-501 or 11-501.1.\n\n\n(b) The Illinois State Police shall create a pilot program to establish the effectiveness of pupillometer technology (the measurement of the pupil’s reaction to light) as a noninvasive technique to detect and measure possible impairment of any person who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle resulting from the suspected usage of alcohol, other drug or drugs, intoxicating compound or compounds or any combination thereof. This technology shall also be used to detect fatigue levels of the operator of a Commercial Motor Vehicle as defined in Section 6-500(6), pursuant to Section 18b-105 (Part 395-Hours of Service of Drivers) of the Illinois Vehicle Code. A State Police officer may request that the operator of a commercial motor vehicle have his or her eyes examined or tested with a pupillometer device. The person may refuse the examination or test. The State Police officer shall have the device readily available to limit undue delays.\n\n\nIf a State Police officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that a person is violating or has violated Section 11-501, the officer may use the pupillometer technology, when available. The officer, prior to an arrest, may request the person to have his or her eyes examined or tested with a pupillometer device. The person may refuse the examination or test.

Driver involvement in personal injury or fatal motor vehicle crash; chemical test.\n\n(a) Any person who drives or is in actual control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this State and who has been involved in a personal injury or fatal motor vehicle crash, shall be deemed to have given consent to a breath test using a portable device as approved by the Illinois State Police or to a chemical test or tests of blood, breath, other bodily substance, or urine for the purpose of determining the content of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds of such person’s blood if arrested as evidenced by the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket for any violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, with the exception of equipment violations contained in Chapter 12 of this Code, or similar provisions of local ordinances. The test or tests shall be administered at the direction of the arresting officer. The law enforcement agency employing the officer shall designate which of the aforesaid tests shall be administered. Up to 2 additional tests of urine or other bodily substance may be administered even after a blood or breath test or both has been administered. Compliance with this Section does not relieve such person from the requirements of Section 11-501.1 of this Code.\n\n\n(b) Any person who is dead, unconscious or who is otherwise in a condition rendering such person incapable of refusal shall be deemed not to have withdrawn the consent provided by subsection (a) of this Section. In addition, if a driver of a vehicle is receiving medical treatment as a result of a motor vehicle crash, any physician licensed to practice medicine, licensed physician assistant, licensed advanced practice registered nurse, registered nurse or a phlebotomist acting under the direction of a licensed physician shall withdraw blood for testing purposes to ascertain the presence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds, upon the specific request of a law enforcement officer. However, no such testing shall be performed until, in the opinion of the medical personnel on scene, the withdrawal can be made without interfering with or endangering the well-being of the patient.\n\n\n(c) A person requested to submit to a test as provided above shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or testing discloses the presence of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis Control Act with a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration as defined in paragraph 6 of subsection (a) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act as detected in such person’s blood, other bodily substance, or urine, may result in the suspension of such person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle. If the person is also a CDL holder, he or she shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis, as covered by the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act as detected in the person’s blood, other bodily substance, or urine, may result in the disqualification of the person’s privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle, as provided in Section 6-514 of this Code. The length of the suspension shall be the same as outlined in Section 6-208.1 of this Code regarding statutory summary suspensions.\n\n\nA person requested to submit to a test shall also acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the warning required under this Section.

However, should the sworn report be defective by not containing sufficient information or be completed in error, the notice of the suspension and disqualification shall not be mailed to the person or entered to the driving record, but rather the sworn report shall be returned to the issuing law enforcement agency.\n\n\n(e) A driver may contest this suspension of his or her driving privileges and disqualification of his or her CDL privileges by requesting an administrative hearing with the Secretary in accordance with Section 2-118 of this Code. At the conclusion of a hearing held under Section 2-118 of this Code, the Secretary may rescind, continue, or modify the orders of suspension and disqualification. If the Secretary does not rescind the orders of suspension and disqualification, a restricted driving permit may be granted by the Secretary upon application being made and good cause shown. A restricted driving permit may be granted to relieve undue hardship to allow driving for employment, educational, and medical purposes as outlined in Section 6-206 of this Code. The provisions of Section 6-206 of this Code shall apply. In accordance with 49 C.F.R. 384, the Secretary of State may not issue a restricted driving permit for the operation of a commercial motor vehicle to a person holding a CDL whose driving privileges have been suspended, revoked, cancelled, or disqualified.\n\n\n(f) (Blank).\n\n\n(g) For the purposes of this Section, a personal injury shall include any type A injury as indicated on the traffic crash report completed by a law enforcement officer that requires immediate professional attention in either a doctor’s office or a medical facility. A type A injury shall include severely bleeding wounds, distorted extremities, and injuries that require the injured party to be carried from the scene.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 102-982, eff. 7-1-23.)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-501.7) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 11-501.7)\n\n(Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 102-982 )"

    "text": "Sec. 11-501.8. Suspension of driver’s license; persons under age 21.\n\n(a) A person who is less than 21 years of age and who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this State shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test or tests of blood, breath, other bodily substance, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol content of the person’s blood if arrested, as evidenced by the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket for any violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, if a police officer has probable cause to believe that the driver has consumed any amount of an alcoholic beverage based upon evidence of the driver’s physical condition or other first hand knowledge of the police officer. The test or tests shall be administered at the direction of the arresting officer. The law enforcement agency employing the officer shall designate which of the aforesaid tests shall be administered. Up to 2 additional tests of urine or other bodily substance may be administered even after a blood or breath test or both has been administered.\n\n\n(b) A person who is dead, unconscious, or who is otherwise in a condition rendering that person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed not to have withdrawn the consent provided by paragraph (a) of this Section and the test or tests may be administered subject to the following provisions:\n\n\n(i) Chemical analysis of the person’s blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance, to be considered valid under the provisions of this Section, shall have been performed according to standards promulgated by the Illinois State Police by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by that Department for this purpose. The Director of the Illinois State Police is authorized to approve satisfactory techniques or methods, to ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals to conduct analyses, to issue permits that shall be subject to termination or revocation at the direction of that Department, and to certify the accuracy of breath testing equipment. The Illinois State Police shall prescribe regulations as necessary.\n\n\n(ii) When a person submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under the provisions of this Section, only a physician authorized to practice medicine, a licensed physician assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, a registered nurse, or other qualified person trained in venipuncture and acting under the direction of a licensed physician may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol content therein. This limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, other bodily substance, or urine specimens.\n\n\n(iii) The person tested may have a physician, qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of his or her own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any test or tests administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the consideration of the previously performed chemical test.\n\n\n(iv) Upon a request of the person who submits to a chemical test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or that person’s attorney.\n\n\n(v) Alcohol concentration means either grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.\n\n\n(vi) If a driver is receiving medical treatment as a result of a motor vehicle crashes, a physician licensed to practice medicine, licensed physician assistant, licensed advanced practice registered nurse, registered nurse, or other qualified person trained in venipuncture and acting under the direction of a licensed physician shall withdraw blood for testing purposes to ascertain the presence of alcohol upon the specific request of a law enforcement officer. However, that testing shall not be performed until, in the opinion of the medical personnel on scene, the withdrawal can be made without interfering with or endangering the well-being of the patient.\n\n\n(c) A person requested to submit to a test as provided above shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00, may result in the loss of that person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle and may result in the disqualification of the person’s privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle, as provided in Section 6-514 of this Code, if the person is a CDL holder. The loss of driving privileges shall be imposed in accordance with Section 6-208.2 of this Code. A person requested to submit to a test shall also acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the warning required under this Section. If the person refuses to acknowledge receipt of the warning, the law enforcement officer shall make a written notation on the warning that the person refused to sign the warning. A person’s refusal to sign the warning shall not be evidence that the person was not read the warning.\n\n\n(d) If the person refuses testing or submits to a test that discloses an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00, the law enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the Secretary of State on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, certifying that the test or tests were requested under subsection (a) and the person refused to submit to a test or tests or submitted to testing which disclosed an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00. The law enforcement officer shall submit the same sworn report when a person under the age of 21 submits to testing under Section 11-501.1 of this Code and the testing discloses an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 and less than 0.08.\n\n\nUpon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the Secretary of State shall enter the suspension and disqualification on the individual’s driving record and the suspension and disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice of the suspension was given to the person. If this suspension is the individual’s first driver’s license suspension under this Section, reports received by the Secretary of State under this Section shall, except during the time the suspension is in effect, be privileged information and for use only by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities, the Secretary of State, or the individual personally, unless the person is a CDL holder, is operating a commercial motor vehicle or vehicle required to be placarded for hazardous materials, in which case the suspension shall not be privileged. Reports received by the Secretary of State under this Section shall also be made available to the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 years that holds an instruction permit or a graduated driver’s license, regardless of whether the suspension is in effect.\n\n\nThe law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report shall serve immediate notice of this suspension on the person and the suspension and disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.\n\n\nIn cases where the blood alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 is established by a subsequent analysis of blood, other bodily substance, or urine, the police officer or arresting agency shall give notice as provided in this Section or by deposit in the United States mail of that notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to that person at his last known address and the loss of driving privileges shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.\n\n\nUpon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the Secretary of State shall also give notice of the suspension and disqualification to the driver by mailing a notice of the effective date of the suspension and disqualification to the individual. However, should the sworn report be defective by not containing sufficient information or be completed in error, the notice of the suspension and disqualification shall not be mailed to the person or entered to the driving record, but rather the sworn report shall be returned to the issuing law enforcement agency.\n\n\n(e) A driver may contest this suspension and disqualification by requesting an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State in accordance with Section 2-118 of this Code. An individual whose blood alcohol concentration is shown to be more than 0.00 is not subject to this Section if he or she consumed alcohol in the performance of a religious service or ceremony. An individual whose blood alcohol concentration is shown to be more than 0.00 shall not be subject to this Section if the individual’s blood alcohol concentration resulted only from ingestion of the prescribed or recommended dosage of medicine that contained alcohol. The petition for that hearing shall not stay or delay the effective date of the impending suspension. The scope of this hearing shall be limited to the issues of:\n\n\n(1) whether the police officer had probable cause to believe that the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of the State and the police officer had reason to believe that the person was in violation of any provision of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance; and\n\n\n(2) whether the person was issued a Uniform Traffic Ticket for any violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance; and\n\n\n(3) whether the police officer had probable cause to believe that the driver had consumed any amount of an alcoholic beverage based upon the driver’s physical actions or other first-hand knowledge of the police officer; and\n\n\n(4) whether the person, after being advised by the officer that the privilege to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended if the person refused to submit to and complete the test or tests, did refuse to submit to or complete the test or tests to determine the person’s alcohol concentration; and\n\n\n(5) whether the person, after being advised by the officer that the privileges to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended if the person submits to a chemical test or tests and the test or tests disclose an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00, did submit to and complete the test or tests that determined an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00; and\n\n\n(6) whether the test result of an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 was based upon the person’s consumption of alcohol in the performance of a religious service or ceremony; and\n\n\n(7) whether the test result of an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 was based upon the person’s consumption of alcohol through ingestion of the prescribed or recommended dosage of medicine.\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing held under Section 2-118 of this Code, the Secretary of State may rescind, continue, or modify the suspension and disqualification. If the Secretary of State does not rescind the suspension and disqualification, a restricted driving permit may be granted by the Secretary of State upon application being made and good cause shown. A restricted driving permit may be granted to relieve undue hardship by allowing driving for employment, educational, and medical purposes as outlined in item (3) of part (c) of Section 6-206 of this Code. The provisions of item (3) of part (c) of Section 6-206 of this Code and of subsection (f) of that Section shall apply. The Secretary of State shall promulgate rules providing for participation in an alcohol education and awareness program or activity, a drug education and awareness program or activity, or both as a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving permit for suspensions imposed under this Section. (f) The results of any chemical testing performed in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section are not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding, except that the results of the testing may be considered at a hearing held under Section 2-118 of this Code. However, the results of the testing may not be used to impose driver’s license sanctions under Section 11-501.1 of this Code. A law enforcement officer may, however, pursue a statutory summary suspension or revocation of driving privileges under Section 11-501.1 of this Code if other physical evidence or first hand knowledge forms the basis of that suspension or revocation.\n\n\n(g) This Section applies only to drivers who are under age 21 at the time of the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket for a violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, and a chemical test request is made under this Section.\n\n\n(h) The action of the Secretary of State in suspending, revoking, cancelling, or disqualifying any license or permit shall be subject to judicial review in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County or in the Circuit Court of Cook County, and the provisions of the Administrative Review Law and its rules are hereby adopted and shall apply to and govern every action for the judicial review of final acts or decisions of the Secretary of State under this Section.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 102-982, eff. 7-1-23.)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-501.9)"

    "text": "Sec. 11-501.9. Suspension of driver’s license; failure or refusal of validated roadside chemical tests; failure or refusal of field sobriety tests; implied consent.\n\n(a) A person who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this State shall be deemed to have given consent to (i) validated roadside chemical tests or (ii) standardized field sobriety tests approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, under subsection (a-5) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, if detained by a law enforcement officer who has a reasonable suspicion that the person is driving or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis. The law enforcement officer must have an independent, cannabis-related factual basis giving reasonable suspicion that the person is driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis for conducting validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests, which shall be included with the results of the validated roadside chemical tests and field sobriety tests in any report made by the law enforcement officer who requests the test. The person’s possession of a registry identification card issued under the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act alone is not a sufficient basis for reasonable suspicion.\n\n\nFor purposes of this Section, a law enforcement officer of this State who is investigating a person for an offense under Section 11-501 of this Code may travel into an adjoining state where the person has been transported for medical care to complete an investigation and to request that the person submit to field sobriety tests under this Section.\n\n\n(b) A person who is unconscious, or otherwise in a condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have withdrawn the consent provided by subsection (a) of this Section.\n\n\n(c) A person requested to submit to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests, as provided in this Section, shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the field sobriety tests that a refusal to submit to the validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle, as provided in subsection (f) of this Section. The person shall also be warned by the law enforcement officer that if the person submits to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests as provided in this Section which disclose the person is impaired by the use of cannabis, a suspension of the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle, as provided in subsection (f) of this Section, will be imposed.\n\n\n(d) The results of validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests administered under this Section shall be admissible in a civil or criminal action or proceeding arising from an arrest for an offense as defined in Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance. These test results shall be admissible only in actions or proceedings directly related to the incident upon which the test request was made.\n\n\n(e) If the person refuses validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests or submits to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests that disclose the person is impaired by the use of cannabis, the law enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the circuit court of venue and the Secretary of State certifying that testing was requested under this Section and that the person refused to submit to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests or submitted to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests that disclosed the person was impaired by the use of cannabis. The sworn report must include the law enforcement officer’s factual basis for reasonable suspicion that the person was impaired by the use of cannabis.\n\n\n(f) Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer submitted under subsection (e) of this Section, the Secretary of State shall enter the suspension to the driving record as follows:\n\n\n(1) for refusal or failure to complete validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests, a 12-month suspension shall be entered; or\n\n\n(2) for submitting to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests that disclosed the driver was impaired by the use of cannabis, a 6-month suspension shall be entered.\n\n\nThe Secretary of State shall confirm the suspension by mailing a notice of the effective date of the suspension to the person and the court of venue. However, should the sworn report be defective for insufficient information or be completed in error, the confirmation of the suspension shall not be mailed to the person or entered to the record; instead, the sworn report shall be forwarded to the court of venue with a copy returned to the issuing agency identifying the defect. (g) The law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report under subsection (e) of this Section shall serve immediate notice of the suspension on the person and the suspension shall be effective as provided in subsection (h) of this Section. If immediate notice of the suspension cannot be given, the arresting officer or arresting agency shall give notice by deposit in the United States mail of the notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to the person at his or her address as shown on the Uniform Traffic Ticket and the suspension shall begin as provided in subsection (h) of this Section. The officer shall confiscate any Illinois driver’s license or permit on the person at the time of arrest. If the person has a valid driver’s license or permit, the officer shall issue the person a receipt, in a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, that will allow the person to drive during the period provided for in subsection (h) of this Section. The officer shall immediately forward the driver’s license or permit to the circuit court of venue along with the sworn report under subsection (e) of this Section.\n\n\n(h) The suspension under subsection (f) of this Section shall take effect on the 46th day following the date the notice of the suspension was given to the person.\n\n\n(i) When a driving privilege has been suspended under this Section and the person is subsequently convicted of violating Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, for the same incident, any period served on suspension under this Section shall be credited toward the minimum period of revocation of driving privileges imposed under Section 6-205 of this Code.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-27, eff. 6-25-19; 101-363, eff. 8-9-19; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21.)\n\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-501.10)"

This hearing shall take place prior to the youth’s aftercare release. The Department shall schedule the protest hearing date, providing at least 15 days’ notice to the State’s Attorney.

The recordings shall be retained by the Department and shall be considered during any subsequent aftercare release decision if the victim or State’s Attorney submits in writing a declaration clearly identifying the recording as representing the position of the victim or State’s Attorney regarding the release of the youth.\n\n\n(j) The Department shall not release a youth eligible for aftercare release if it determines that:\n\n\n(1) there is a substantial risk that he or she will not conform to reasonable conditions of aftercare release;\n\n\n(2) his or her release at that time would deprecate the seriousness of his or her offense or promote disrespect for the law; or\n\n\n(3) his or her release would have a substantially adverse effect on institutional discipline.\n\n\n(k) The Department shall render its release decision and shall state the basis therefor both in the records of the Department and in written notice to the youth who was considered for aftercare release. In its decision, the Department shall set the youth’s time for aftercare release, or if it denies aftercare release it shall provide for reconsideration of aftercare release not less frequently than once each year.\n\n\n(l) The Department shall ensure all evaluations and proceedings under the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act are completed prior to any youth’s release, when applicable.\n\n\n(m) Any youth whose aftercare release has been revoked by the Prisoner Review Board under Section 3-3-9.5 of this Code may be rereleased to the full aftercare release term by the Department at any time in accordance with this Section.

In your request you must set forth specific reasons why you feel the Board’s release date is unfair and you may submit relevant material in support of your request.\n\n\nThe Department of Corrections is obligated to assist you in that effort, if you ask it to do so.\n\n\nThe Board will notify you within 60 days whether or not it will reconsider its decision. The Board’s decision with respect to reconsidering your release date is final and cannot be appealed to any court.\n\n\nIf the Board decides not to reconsider your case you will have 60 days in which to decide whether to accept the release date and waive your right to parole or to continue under the parole system. If you do nothing within 60 days after you receive notification of the Board’s decision you will remain under the parole system.\n\n\nIf the Board decides to reconsider its decision with respect to your release date, the Board will schedule a date for reconsideration as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days from the date it receives your request, and give you at least 30 days notice. You may submit material to the Board which you believe will be helpful in deciding a proper date for your release. The Department of Corrections is obligated to assist you in that effort, if you ask it to do so.\n\n\nNeither you nor your lawyer has the right to be present on the date of reconsideration, nor the right to call witnesses. However, the Board may ask you or your lawyer to appear or may ask to hear witnesses. The Board will base its determination on the same data on which it made its earlier determination, plus any new information which may be available to it.\n\n\nWhen the Board has made its decision you will be informed of the release date. In no event will it be longer than the release date originally determined. From this date you may continue to accumulate good conduct credits at the maximum rate. You will not be able to appeal the Board’s decision to a court.\n\n\nFollowing the Board’s reconsideration and upon being notified of your release date you will have 60 days in which to decide whether to accept the release date and waive your right to parole or to continue under the parole system. If you do nothing within 60 days after notification of the Board’s decision you will remain under the parole system.”\n\n\n(d) The Board shall provide each eligible offender with a form substantially as follows:\n\n\n“I (name of offender) am fully aware of my right to choose between parole eligibility and a fixed release date. I know that if I accept the release date established, I will give up my right to seek parole. I have read and understood the Prisoner Review Board’s letter, and I know how and under what circumstances the Board has set my release date. I know that I will be released on that date and will be released earlier if I accumulate good conduct credit. I know that the date set by the Board is final, and can’t be appealed to a court.\n\n\nFully aware of all the implications, I expressly and knowingly waive my right to seek parole and accept the release date as established by the Prisoner Review Board.”\n\n\n(e) The Board shall use the following information and standards in establishing a release date for each eligible offender who requests that a date be set:\n\n\n(1) Such information as would be considered in a parole hearing under Section 3-3-4 of this Code;\n\n\n(2) The intent of the court in imposing the offender’s sentence;\n\n\n(3) The present schedule for similar offenses provided by Articles 4.5 and 5 of Chapter V of this Code;\n\n\n(4) Factors in aggravation and mitigation of sentence as provided in Sections 5-5-3.1 and 5-5-3.2 of this Code;\n\n\n(5) The rate of accumulating good conduct credits provided by Section 3-6-3 of this Code;\n\n\n(6) The offender’s behavior since commitment to the Department.\n\n\n(f) After the release date is set by the Board, the offender can accumulate good conduct credits in accordance with Section 3-6-3 of this Code.\n\n\n(g) The release date established by the Board shall not be sooner than the earliest date that the offender would have been eligible for release under the sentence imposed on him by the court, less time credit previously earned for good behavior, nor shall it be later than the latest date at which the offender would have been eligible for release under such sentence, less time credit previously earned for good behavior.\n\n\n(h) (1) Except as provided in subsection (b), each prisoner appearing at his next parole hearing subsequent to the effective date of the amendatory Act of 1977, shall be notified within 7 days of the hearing that he will either be released on parole or that a release date has been set by the Board. The notice and waiver form provided for in subsections (c) and (d) shall be presented to eligible prisoners no later than 7 days following their parole hearing. A written statement of the basis for the decision with regard to the release date set shall be given to such prisoners no later than 14 days following the parole hearing.\n\n\n(2) Each prisoner upon notification of his release date shall have 60 days to choose whether to remain under the parole system or to accept the release date established by the Board. No release date shall be effective unless the prisoner waives his right to parole in writing. If no choice is made by such prisoner within 60 days from the date of his notification of a release date, such prisoner shall remain under the parole system.\n\n\n(3) Within the 60 day period as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a prisoner may request that the Board reconsider its decision with regard to such prisoner’s release date. No later than 60 days following receipt of such request for reconsideration, the Board shall notify the prisoner as to whether or not it will reconsider such prisoner’s release date. No court shall have jurisdiction to review the Board’s decision. No prisoner shall be entitled to more than one request for reconsideration of his release date.\n\n\n(A) If the Board decides not to reconsider the release date, the prisoner shall have 60 days to choose whether to remain under the parole system or to accept the release date established by the Board. No release date shall be effective unless the prisoner waives his right to parole in writing. If no choice is made by such prisoner within 60 days from the date of the notification by the Board refusing to reconsider his release date, such prisoner shall remain under the parole system.\n\n\n(B) If the Board decides to reconsider its decision with respect to such release date, the Board shall schedule a date for reconsideration as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days from the date of the prisoner’s request, and give such prisoner at least 30 days notice. Such prisoner may submit any relevant material to the Board which would aid in ascertaining a proper release date. The Department of Corrections shall assist any such prisoner if asked to do so.\n\n\nNeither the prisoner nor his lawyer has the right to be present on the date of reconsideration, nor the right to call witnesses. However, the Board may ask such prisoner or his or her lawyer to appear or may ask to hear witnesses. The Board shall base its determination on the factors specified in subsection (e), plus any new information which may be available to it.\n\n\n(C) When the Board has made its decision, the prisoner shall be informed of the release date as provided for in subsection (c) no later than 7 days following the reconsideration. In no event shall such release date be longer than the release date originally determined. The decision of the Board is final. No court shall have jurisdiction to review the Board’s decision.\n\n\nFollowing the Board’s reconsideration and its notification to the prisoner of his or her release date, such prisoner shall have 60 days from the date of such notice in which to decide whether to accept the release date and waive his or her right to parole or to continue under the parole system. If such prisoner does nothing within 60 days after notification of the Board’s decision, he or she shall remain under the parole system.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 95-1052, eff. 7-1-09; 96-1000, eff. 7-2-10.)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/3-3-3) (from Ch. 38, par. 1003-3-3)"

The person shall be assisted in preparing his or her parole plan by personnel of the Department of Corrections, and may, for this purpose, be released on furlough under Article 11. The Department shall also provide assistance in obtaining information and records helpful to the individual for his or her parole hearing.

    "text": "Sec. 3-3-14. Procedure for medical release.\n\n(a) Definitions.\n\n\n(1) As used in this Section, “medically incapacitated” means that an inmate has any diagnosable medical condition, including dementia and severe, permanent medical or cognitive disability, that prevents the inmate from completing more than one activity of daily living without assistance or that incapacitates the inmate to the extent that institutional confinement does not offer additional restrictions, and that the condition is unlikely to improve noticeably in the future.\n\n\n(2) As used in this Section, “terminal illness” means a condition that satisfies all of the following criteria:\n\n\n(i) the condition is irreversible and incurable; and\n\n\n(ii) in accordance with medical standards and a reasonable degree of medical certainty, based on an individual assessment of the inmate, the condition is likely to cause death to the inmate within 18 months.\n\n\n(b) The Prisoner Review Board shall consider an application for compassionate release on behalf of any inmate who meets any of the following:\n\n\n(1) is suffering from a terminal illness; or\n\n\n(2) has been diagnosed with a condition that will result in medical incapacity within the next 6 months; or\n\n\n(3) has become medically incapacitated subsequent to sentencing due to illness or injury.\n\n\n(c) Initial application.\n\n\n(1) An initial application for medical release may be filed with the Prisoner Review Board by an inmate, a prison official, a medical professional who has treated or diagnosed the inmate, or an inmate’s spouse, parent, guardian, grandparent, aunt or uncle, sibling, child over the age of eighteen years, or attorney. If the initial application is made by someone other than the inmate, the inmate, or if the inmate is medically unable to consent, the guardian or family member designated to represent the inmate’s interests must consent to the application at the time of the institutional hearing.\n\n\n(2) Application materials shall be maintained on the Prisoner Review Board’s website and the Department of Corrections’ website and maintained in a clearly visible place within the law library and the infirmary of every penal institution and facility operated by the Department of Corrections.\n\n\n(3) The initial application need not be notarized, can be sent via email or facsimile, and must contain the following information:\n\n\n(i) the inmate’s name and Illinois Department of Corrections number;\n\n\n(ii) the inmate’s diagnosis;\n\n\n(iii) a statement that the inmate meets one of the following diagnostic criteria:\n\n\n(A) the inmate is suffering from a terminal illness;\n\n\n(B) the inmate has been diagnosed with a condition that will result in medical incapacity within the next 6 months; or\n\n\n(C) the inmate has become medically incapacitated subsequent to sentencing due to illness or injury.\n\n\n(4) Upon receiving the inmate’s initial application, the Board shall order the Department of Corrections to have a physician or nurse practitioner evaluate the inmate and create a written evaluation within ten days of the Board’s order. The evaluation shall include but need not be limited to:\n\n\n(i) a concise statement of the inmate’s medical diagnosis, including prognosis, likelihood of recovery, and primary symptoms, to include incapacitation; and\n\n\n(ii) a statement confirming or denying that the inmate meets one of the criteria stated in subsection (b) of this Section.\n\n\n(d) Institutional hearing. No public institutional hearing is required for consideration of a petition, but shall be granted at the request of the petitioner. The inmate may be represented by counsel and may present witnesses to the Board members. Hearings shall be governed by the Open Parole Hearings Act.\n\n\n(e) Voting procedure. Petitions shall be considered by three-member panels, and decisions shall be made by simple majority.\n\n\n(f) Consideration. In considering a petition for release under the statute, the Prisoner Review Board may consider the following factors:\n\n\n(i) the inmate’s diagnosis and likelihood of recovery;\n\n\n(ii) the approximate cost of health care to the State should the inmate remain in custody;\n\n\n(iii) the impact that the inmate’s continued incarceration may have on the provision of medical care within the Department;\n\n\n(iv) the present likelihood of and ability to pose a substantial danger to the physical safety of a specifically identifiable person or persons;\n\n\n(v) any statements by the victim regarding release; and\n\n\n(vi) whether the inmate’s condition was explicitly disclosed to the original sentencing judge and taken into account at the time of sentencing.\n\n\n(g) Inmates granted medical release shall be released on mandatory supervised release for a period of 5 years subject to Section 3-3-8, which shall operate to discharge any remaining term of years imposed upon him or her. However, in no event shall the eligible person serve a period of mandatory supervised release greater than the aggregate of the discharged underlying sentence and the mandatory supervised release period as set forth in Section 5-4.5-20.\n\n\n(h) Within 90 days of the receipt of the initial application, the Prisoner Review Board shall conduct a hearing if a hearing is requested and render a decision granting or denying the petitioner’s request for release.\n\n\n(i) Nothing in this statute shall preclude a petitioner from seeking alternative forms of release, including clemency, relief from the sentencing court, post-conviction relief, or any other legal remedy.\n\n\n(j) This act applies retroactively, and shall be applicable to all currently incarcerated people in Illinois.\n\n\n(k) Data report. The Department of Corrections and the Prisoner Review Board shall release a report annually published on their websites that reports the following information about the Medical Release Program:\n\n\n(1) The number of applications for medical release received by the Board in the preceding year, and information about those applications, including:\n\n\n(i) demographic data about the individual, including race or ethnicity, gender, age, and institution;\n\n\n(ii) the highest class of offense for which the individual is incarcerated;\n\n\n(iii) the relationship of the applicant to the person completing the application;\n\n\n(iv) whether the applicant had applied for medical release before and been denied, and, if so, when;\n\n\n(v) whether the person applied as a person who is medically incapacitated or a person who is terminally ill; and\n\n\n(vi) a basic description of the underlying medical condition that led to the application.\n\n\n(2) The number of medical statements from the Department of Corrections received by the Board.\n\n\n(3) The number of institutional hearings on medical release applications conducted by the Board.\n\n\n(4) The number of people approved for medical release, and information about them, including:\n\n\n(i) demographic data about the individual including race or ethnicity, gender, age, and zip code to which they were released;\n\n\n(ii) whether the person applied as a person who is medically incapacitated or a person who is terminally ill;\n\n\n(iii) a basic description of the underlying medical condition that led to the application; and\n\n\n(iv) a basic description of the medical setting the person was released to.\n\n\n(5) The number of people released on the medical release program.\n\n\n(6) The number of people approved for medical release who experienced more than a one-month delay between release decision and ultimate release, including:\n\n\n(i) demographic data about the individuals including race or ethnicity, gender and age;\n\n\n(ii) the reason for the delay;\n\n\n(iii) whether the person remains incarcerated; and\n\n\n(iv) a basic description of the underlying medical condition of the applying person.\n\n\n(7) For those individuals released on mandatory supervised release due to a granted application for medical release:\n\n\n(i) the number of individuals who were serving terms of mandatory supervised release because of medical release applications during the previous year;\n\n\n(ii) the number of individuals who had their mandatory supervised release revoked; and\n\n\n(iii) the number of individuals who died during the previous year.\n\n\n(8) Information on seriously ill individuals incarcerated at the Department of Corrections, including:\n\n\n(i) the number of people currently receiving full-time one-on-one medical care or assistance with activities of daily living within Department of Corrections facilities and whether that care is provided by a medical practitioner or an inmate, along with the institutions at which they are incarcerated; and\n\n\n(ii) the number of people who spent more than one month in outside hospital care during the previous year and their home institutions.\n\n\nAll the information provided in this report shall be provided in aggregate, and nothing shall be construed to require the public dissemination of any personal medical information.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 102-494, eff. 1-1-22; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22.)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/3-3-15)"

Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of such states upon similar action by such state.\nWITHDRAWAL AND TERMINATION\nThis compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the compact and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in the statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawal state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.\nOTHER ARRANGEMENTS UNAFFECTED\nNothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair an agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a non-party state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates, nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.\nCONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\nThe provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n(b) Powers. The Department of Corrections is authorized and directed to do all things necessary or incidental to the carrying out of the compact in every particular.\n(Source: P.A. 77-2097.)"

    "text": "Sec. 3-6-2. Institutions and facility administration.\n\n(a) Each institution and facility of the Department shall be administered by a chief administrative officer appointed by the Director. A chief administrative officer shall be responsible for all persons assigned to the institution or facility. The chief administrative officer shall administer the programs of the Department for the custody and treatment of such persons.\n\n\n(b) The chief administrative officer shall have such assistants as the Department may assign.\n\n\n(c) The Director or Assistant Director shall have the emergency powers to temporarily transfer individuals without formal procedures to any State, county, municipal or regional correctional or detention institution or facility in the State, subject to the acceptance of such receiving institution or facility, or to designate any reasonably secure place in the State as such an institution or facility and to make transfers thereto. However, transfers made under emergency powers shall be reviewed as soon as practicable under Article 8, and shall be subject to Section 5-905 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. This Section shall not apply to transfers to the Department of Human Services which are provided for under Section 3-8-5 or Section 3-10-5.\n\n\n(d) The Department of Juvenile Justice shall provide educational programs for all committed youth so that all youth have an opportunity to attain the achievement level equivalent to the completion of the twelfth grade in the public school system in this State. Other higher levels of attainment shall be encouraged and professional instruction shall be maintained wherever possible. The Department may establish programs of mandatory education and may establish rules and regulations for the administration of such programs. A person committed to the Department of Corrections who, during the period of his or her incarceration, participates in an educational program provided by or through the Department of Corrections and through that program is awarded or earns the number of hours of credit required for the award of an associate, baccalaureate, or higher degree from a community college, college, or university located in Illinois shall reimburse the State, through the Department of Corrections, for the costs incurred by the State in providing that person during his or her incarceration with the education that qualifies him or her for the award of that degree. The costs for which reimbursement is required under this subsection shall be determined and computed by the Department of Corrections under rules and regulations that it shall establish for that purpose. However, interest at the rate of 6% per annum shall be charged on the balance of those costs from time to time remaining unpaid, from the date of the person’s parole, mandatory supervised release, or release constituting a final termination of his or her commitment to the Department of Corrections until paid.\n\n\n(d-5) A person committed to the Department is entitled to confidential testing for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to counseling in connection with such testing, with no copay to the committed person. A person committed to the Department who has tested positive for infection with HIV is entitled to medical care while incarcerated, counseling, and referrals to support services, in connection with that positive test result. Implementation of this subsection (d-5) is subject to appropriation.\n\n\n(e) A person committed to the Department who becomes in need of medical or surgical treatment but is incapable of giving consent thereto shall receive such medical or surgical treatment by the chief administrative officer consenting on the person’s behalf. Before the chief administrative officer consents, he or she shall obtain the advice of one or more physicians licensed to practice medicine in all its branches in this State. If such physician or physicians advise:\n\n\n(1) that immediate medical or surgical treatment is required relative to a condition threatening to cause death, damage or impairment to bodily functions, or disfigurement; and\n\n\n(2) that the person is not capable of giving consent to such treatment; the chief administrative officer may give consent for such medical or surgical treatment, and such consent shall be deemed to be the consent of the person for all purposes, including, but not limited to, the authority of a physician to give such treatment.\n\n\n(e-5) If a physician providing medical care to a committed person on behalf of the Department advises the chief administrative officer that the committed person’s mental or physical health has deteriorated as a result of the cessation of ingestion of food or liquid to the point where medical or surgical treatment is required to prevent death, damage, or impairment to bodily functions, the chief administrative officer may authorize such medical or surgical treatment.\n\n\n(f) In the event that the person requires medical care and treatment at a place other than the institution or facility, the person may be removed therefrom under conditions prescribed by the Department. Neither the Department of Corrections nor the Department of Juvenile Justice may require a committed person or person committed to any facility operated by the Department of Juvenile Justice, as set forth in Section 3-2.5-15 of this Code, to pay any co-payment for receiving medical or dental services.\n\n\n(f-5) The Department shall comply with the Health Care Violence Prevention Act.\n\n\n(g) Any person having sole custody of a child at the time of commitment or any woman giving birth to a child after her commitment, may arrange through the Department of Children and Family Services for suitable placement of the child outside of the Department of Corrections.

The sex offender evaluation shall be conducted in conformance with the standards and guidelines developed under the Sex Offender Management Board Act and by an evaluator approved by the Board.\n\n\n(k) Any minor committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice for a sex offense as defined by the Sex Offender Management Board Act shall be required to undergo sex offender treatment by a treatment provider approved by the Board and conducted in conformance with the Sex Offender Management Board Act.\n\n\n(l) Prior to the release of any inmate committed to a facility of the Department or the Department of Juvenile Justice, the Department must provide the inmate with appropriate information verbally, in writing, by video, or other electronic means, concerning HIV and AIDS. The Department shall develop the informational materials in consultation with the Department of Public Health. At the same time, the Department must also offer the committed person the option of testing for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with no copayment for the test. Pre-test information shall be provided to the committed person and informed consent obtained as required in subsection (d) of Section 3 and Section 5 of the AIDS Confidentiality Act. The Department may conduct opt-out HIV testing as defined in Section 4 of the AIDS Confidentiality Act. If the Department conducts opt-out HIV testing, the Department shall place signs in English, Spanish and other languages as needed in multiple, highly visible locations in the area where HIV testing is conducted informing inmates that they will be tested for HIV unless they refuse, and refusal or acceptance of testing shall be documented in the inmate’s medical record. The Department shall follow procedures established by the Department of Public Health to conduct HIV testing and testing to confirm positive HIV test results. All testing must be conducted by medical personnel, but pre-test and other information may be provided by committed persons who have received appropriate training. The Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Health, shall develop a plan that complies with the AIDS Confidentiality Act to deliver confidentially all positive or negative HIV test results to inmates or former inmates. Nothing in this Section shall require the Department to offer HIV testing to an inmate who is known to be infected with HIV, or who has been tested for HIV within the previous 180 days and whose documented HIV test result is available to the Department electronically. The testing provided under this subsection (l) shall consist of a test approved by the Illinois Department of Public Health to determine the presence of HIV infection, based upon recommendations of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If the test result is positive, a reliable supplemental test based upon recommendations of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shall be administered.\n\n\nPrior to the release of an inmate who the Department knows has tested positive for infection with HIV, the Department in a timely manner shall offer the inmate transitional case management, including referrals to other support services.\n\n\n(m) The chief administrative officer of each institution or facility of the Department shall make a room in the institution or facility available for substance use disorder services to be provided to committed persons on a voluntary basis. The services shall be provided for one hour once a week at a time specified by the chief administrative officer of the institution or facility if the following conditions are met:\n\n\n(1) the substance use disorder service contacts the chief administrative officer to arrange the meeting;\n\n\n(2) the committed person may attend the meeting for substance use disorder services only if the committed person uses pre-existing free time already available to the committed person;\n\n\n(3) all disciplinary and other rules of the institution or facility remain in effect;\n\n\n(4) the committed person is not given any additional privileges to attend substance use disorder services;\n\n\n(5) if the substance use disorder service does not arrange for scheduling a meeting for that week, no substance use disorder services shall be provided to the committed person in the institution or facility for that week;\n\n\n(6) the number of committed persons who may attend a substance use disorder meeting shall not exceed 40 during any session held at the correctional institution or facility;\n\n\n(7) a volunteer seeking to provide substance use disorder services under this subsection (m) must submit an application to the Department of Corrections under existing Department rules and the Department must review the application within 60 days after submission of the application to the Department; and\n\n\n(8) each institution and facility of the Department shall manage the substance use disorder services program according to its own processes and procedures.\n\n\nFor the purposes of this subsection (m), “substance use disorder services” means recovery services for persons with substance use disorders provided by volunteers of recovery support services recognized by the Department of Human Services.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-81, eff. 7-12-19; 101-86, eff. 1-1-20; 102-350, eff. 8-13-21.)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/3-6-2.5)"

The rules and regulations shall also provide that sentence credit may be provided to an inmate who was held in pre-trial detention prior to his or her current commitment to the Department of Corrections and successfully completed a full-time, 60-day or longer substance abuse program, educational program, behavior modification program, life skills course, or re-entry planning provided by the county department of corrections or county jail. Calculation of this county program credit shall be done at sentencing as provided in Section 5-4.5-100 of this Code and shall be included in the sentencing order. The rules and regulations shall also provide that sentence credit may be provided to an inmate who is in compliance with programming requirements in an adult transition center.\n\n\n(B) The Department shall award sentence credit under this paragraph (4) accumulated prior to January 1, 2020 (the effective date of Public Act 101-440) in an amount specified in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (4) to an inmate serving a sentence for an offense committed prior to June 19, 1998, if the Department determines that the inmate is entitled to this sentence credit, based upon:\n\n\n(i) documentation provided by the Department that the inmate engaged in any full-time substance abuse programs, correctional industry assignments, educational programs, behavior modification programs, life skills courses, or re-entry planning provided by the Department under this paragraph (4) and satisfactorily completed the assigned program as determined by the standards of the Department during the inmate’s current term of incarceration; or\n\n\n(ii) the inmate’s own testimony in the form of an affidavit or documentation, or a third party’s documentation or testimony in the form of an affidavit that the inmate likely engaged in any full-time substance abuse programs, correctional industry assignments, educational programs, behavior modification programs, life skills courses, or re-entry planning provided by the Department under paragraph (4) and satisfactorily completed the assigned program as determined by the standards of the Department during the inmate’s current term of incarceration.\n\n\n(C) If the inmate can provide documentation that he or she is entitled to sentence credit under subparagraph (B) in excess of 45 days of participation in those programs, the inmate shall receive 90 days of sentence credit. If the inmate cannot provide documentation of more than 45 days of participation in those programs, the inmate shall receive 45 days of sentence credit. In the event of a disagreement between the Department and the inmate as to the amount of credit accumulated under subparagraph (B), if the Department provides documented proof of a lesser amount of days of participation in those programs, that proof shall control. If the Department provides no documentary proof, the inmate’s proof as set forth in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) shall control as to the amount of sentence credit provided.\n\n\n(D) If the inmate has been convicted of a sex offense as defined in Section 2 of the Sex Offender Registration Act, sentencing credits under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (4) shall be awarded by the Department only if the conditions set forth in paragraph (4.6) of subsection (a) are satisfied. No inmate serving a term of natural life imprisonment shall receive sentence credit under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (4).\n\n\nEducational, vocational, substance abuse, behavior modification programs, life skills courses, re-entry planning, and correctional industry programs under which sentence credit may be earned under this paragraph (4) and paragraph (4.1) of this subsection (a) shall be evaluated by the Department on the basis of documented standards. The Department shall report the results of these evaluations to the Governor and the General Assembly by September 30th of each year. The reports shall include data relating to the recidivism rate among program participants.\n\n\nAvailability of these programs shall be subject to the limits of fiscal resources appropriated by the General Assembly for these purposes. Eligible inmates who are denied immediate admission shall be placed on a waiting list under criteria established by the Department. The rules and regulations shall provide that a prisoner who has been placed on a waiting list but is transferred for non-disciplinary reasons before beginning a program shall receive priority placement on the waitlist for appropriate programs at the new facility. The inability of any inmate to become engaged in any such programs by reason of insufficient program resources or for any other reason established under the rules and regulations of the Department shall not be deemed a cause of action under which the Department or any employee or agent of the Department shall be liable for damages to the inmate. The rules and regulations shall provide that a prisoner who begins an educational, vocational, substance abuse, work-release programs or activities in accordance with Article 13 of Chapter III of this Code, behavior modification program, life skills course, re-entry planning, or correctional industry programs but is unable to complete the program due to illness, disability, transfer, lockdown, or another reason outside of the prisoner’s control shall receive prorated sentence credits for the days in which the prisoner did participate.\n\n\n(4.1) Except as provided in paragraph (4.7) of this subsection (a), the rules and regulations shall also provide that an additional 90 days of sentence credit shall be awarded to any prisoner who passes high school equivalency testing while the prisoner is committed to the Department of Corrections. The sentence credit awarded under this paragraph (4.1) shall be in addition to, and shall not affect, the award of sentence credit under any other paragraph of this Section, but shall also be pursuant to the guidelines and restrictions set forth in paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of this Section. The sentence credit provided for in this paragraph shall be available only to those prisoners who have not previously earned a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate. If, after an award of the high school equivalency testing sentence credit has been made, the Department determines that the prisoner was not eligible, then the award shall be revoked. The Department may also award 90 days of sentence credit to any committed person who passed high school equivalency testing while he or she was held in pre-trial detention prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections. Except as provided in paragraph (4.7) of this subsection (a), the rules and regulations shall provide that an additional 120 days of sentence credit shall be awarded to any prisoner who obtains an associate degree while the prisoner is committed to the Department of Corrections, regardless of the date that the associate degree was obtained, including if prior to July 1, 2021 (the effective date of Public Act 101-652). The sentence credit awarded under this paragraph (4.1) shall be in addition to, and shall not affect, the award of sentence credit under any other paragraph of this Section, but shall also be under the guidelines and restrictions set forth in paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of this Section. The sentence credit provided for in this paragraph (4.1) shall be available only to those prisoners who have not previously earned an associate degree prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections. If, after an award of the associate degree sentence credit has been made and the Department determines that the prisoner was not eligible, then the award shall be revoked. The Department may also award 120 days of sentence credit to any committed person who earned an associate degree while he or she was held in pre-trial detention prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections.\n\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (4.7) of this subsection (a), the rules and regulations shall provide that an additional 180 days of sentence credit shall be awarded to any prisoner who obtains a bachelor’s degree while the prisoner is committed to the Department of Corrections. The sentence credit awarded under this paragraph (4.1) shall be in addition to, and shall not affect, the award of sentence credit under any other paragraph of this Section, but shall also be under the guidelines and restrictions set forth in paragraph (4) of this subsection (a). The sentence credit provided for in this paragraph shall be available only to those prisoners who have not earned a bachelor’s degree prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections. If, after an award of the bachelor’s degree sentence credit has been made, the Department determines that the prisoner was not eligible, then the award shall be revoked. The Department may also award 180 days of sentence credit to any committed person who earned a bachelor’s degree while he or she was held in pre-trial detention prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections.\n\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (4.7) of this subsection (a), the rules and regulations shall provide that an additional 180 days of sentence credit shall be awarded to any prisoner who obtains a master’s or professional degree while the prisoner is committed to the Department of Corrections. The sentence credit awarded under this paragraph (4.1) shall be in addition to, and shall not affect, the award of sentence credit under any other paragraph of this Section, but shall also be under the guidelines and restrictions set forth in paragraph (4) of this subsection (a). The sentence credit provided for in this paragraph shall be available only to those prisoners who have not previously earned a master’s or professional degree prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections. If, after an award of the master’s or professional degree sentence credit has been made, the Department determines that the prisoner was not eligible, then the award shall be revoked. The Department may also award 180 days of sentence credit to any committed person who earned a master’s or professional degree while he or she was held in pre-trial detention prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections.\n\n\n(4.2) The rules and regulations shall also provide that any prisoner engaged in self-improvement programs, volunteer work, or work assignments that are not otherwise eligible activities under paragraph (4), shall receive up to 0.5 days of sentence credit for each day in which the prisoner is engaged in activities described in this paragraph.\n\n\n(4.5) The rules and regulations on sentence credit shall also provide that when the court’s sentencing order recommends a prisoner for substance abuse treatment and the crime was committed on or after September 1, 2003 (the effective date of Public Act 93-354), the prisoner shall receive no sentence credit awarded under clause (3) of this subsection (a) unless he or she participates in and completes a substance abuse treatment program. The Director of Corrections may waive the requirement to participate in or complete a substance abuse treatment program in specific instances if the prisoner is not a good candidate for a substance abuse treatment program for medical, programming, or operational reasons. Availability of substance abuse treatment shall be subject to the limits of fiscal resources appropriated by the General Assembly for these purposes. If treatment is not available and the requirement to participate and complete the treatment has not been waived by the Director, the prisoner shall be placed on a waiting list under criteria established by the Department. The Director may allow a prisoner placed on a waiting list to participate in and complete a substance abuse education class or attend substance abuse self-help meetings in lieu of a substance abuse treatment program. A prisoner on a waiting list who is not placed in a substance abuse program prior to release may be eligible for a waiver and receive sentence credit under clause (3) of this subsection (a) at the discretion of the Director.\n\n\n(4.6) The rules and regulations on sentence credit shall also provide that a prisoner who has been convicted of a sex offense as defined in Section 2 of the Sex Offender Registration Act shall receive no sentence credit unless he or she either has successfully completed or is participating in sex offender treatment as defined by the Sex Offender Management Board. However, prisoners who are waiting to receive treatment, but who are unable to do so due solely to the lack of resources on the part of the Department, may, at either Director’s sole discretion, be awarded sentence credit at a rate as the Director shall determine.\n\n\n(4.7) On or after January 1, 2018 (the effective date of Public Act 100-3), sentence credit under paragraph (3), (4), or (4.1) of this subsection (a) may be awarded to a prisoner who is serving a sentence for an offense described in paragraph (2), (2.3), (2.4), (2.5), or (2.6) for credit earned on or after January 1, 2018 (the effective date of Public Act 100-3); provided, the award of the credits under this paragraph (4.7) shall not reduce the sentence of the prisoner to less than the following amounts:\n\n\n(i) 85% of his or her sentence if the prisoner is required to serve 85% of his or her sentence; or\n\n\n(ii) 60% of his or her sentence if the prisoner is required to serve 75% of his or her sentence, except if the prisoner is serving a sentence for gunrunning his or her sentence shall not be reduced to less than 75%.\n\n\n(iii) 100% of his or her sentence if the prisoner is required to serve 100% of his or her sentence.\n\n\n(5) Whenever the Department is to release any inmate earlier than it otherwise would because of a grant of earned sentence credit under paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this Section given at any time during the term, the Department shall give reasonable notice of the impending release not less than 14 days prior to the date of the release to the State’s Attorney of the county where the prosecution of the inmate took place, and if applicable, the State’s Attorney of the county into which the inmate will be released. The Department must also make identification information and a recent photo of the inmate being released accessible on the Internet by means of a hyperlink labeled “Community Notification of Inmate Early Release” on the Department’s World Wide Web homepage. The identification information shall include the inmate’s: name, any known alias, date of birth, physical characteristics, commitment offense, and county where conviction was imposed. The identification information shall be placed on the website within 3 days of the inmate’s release and the information may not be removed until either: completion of the first year of mandatory supervised release or return of the inmate to custody of the Department.\n\n\n(b) Whenever a person is or has been committed under several convictions, with separate sentences, the sentences shall be construed under Section 5-8-4 in granting and forfeiting of sentence credit.\n\n\n(c) (1) The Department shall prescribe rules and regulations for revoking sentence credit, including revoking sentence credit awarded under paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this Section. The Department shall prescribe rules and regulations establishing and requiring the use of a sanctions matrix for revoking sentence credit. The Department shall prescribe rules and regulations for suspending or reducing the rate of accumulation of sentence credit for specific rule violations, during imprisonment. These rules and regulations shall provide that no inmate may be penalized more than one year of sentence credit for any one infraction.\n\n\n(2) When the Department seeks to revoke, suspend, or reduce the rate of accumulation of any sentence credits for an alleged infraction of its rules, it shall bring charges therefor against the prisoner sought to be so deprived of sentence credits before the Prisoner Review Board as provided in subparagraph (a)(4) of Section 3-3-2 of this Code, if the amount of credit at issue exceeds 30 days, whether from one infraction or cumulatively from multiple infractions arising out of a single event, or when, during any 12-month period, the cumulative amount of credit revoked exceeds 30 days except where the infraction is committed or discovered within 60 days of scheduled release. In those cases, the Department of Corrections may revoke up to 30 days of sentence credit. The Board may subsequently approve the revocation of additional sentence credit, if the Department seeks to revoke sentence credit in excess of 30 days. However, the Board shall not be empowered to review the Department’s decision with respect to the loss of 30 days of sentence credit within any calendar year for any prisoner or to increase any penalty beyond the length requested by the Department.\n\n\n(3) The Director of Corrections or the Director of Juvenile Justice, in appropriate cases, may restore sentence credits which have been revoked, suspended, or reduced. The Department shall prescribe rules and regulations governing the restoration of sentence credits. These rules and regulations shall provide for the automatic restoration of sentence credits following a period in which the prisoner maintains a record without a disciplinary violation.\n\n\nNothing contained in this Section shall prohibit the Prisoner Review Board from ordering, pursuant to Section 3-3-9(a)(3)(i)(B), that a prisoner serve up to one year of the sentence imposed by the court that was not served due to the accumulation of sentence credit.\n\n\n(d) If a lawsuit is filed by a prisoner in an Illinois or federal court against the State, the Department of Corrections, or the Prisoner Review Board, or against any of their officers or employees, and the court makes a specific finding that a pleading, motion, or other paper filed by the prisoner is frivolous, the Department of Corrections shall conduct a hearing to revoke up to 180 days of sentence credit by bringing charges against the prisoner sought to be deprived of the sentence credits before the Prisoner Review Board as provided in subparagraph (a)(8) of Section 3-3-2 of this Code. If the prisoner has not accumulated 180 days of sentence credit at the time of the finding, then the Prisoner Review Board may revoke all sentence credit accumulated by the prisoner.\n\n\nFor purposes of this subsection (d):\n\n\n(1) “Frivolous” means that a pleading, motion, or other filing which purports to be a legal document filed by a prisoner in his or her lawsuit meets any or all of the following criteria:\n\n\n(A) it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact;\n\n\n(B) it is being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation;\n\n\n(C) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;\n\n\n(D) the allegations and other factual contentions do not have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are not likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; or\n\n\n(E) the denials of factual contentions are not warranted on the evidence, or if specifically so identified, are not reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.\n\n\n(2) “Lawsuit” means a motion pursuant to Section\n\n\n116-3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, a habeas corpus action under Article X of the Code of Civil Procedure or under federal law (28 U.S.C. 2254), a petition for claim under the Court of Claims Act, an action under the federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 1983), or a second or subsequent petition for post-conviction relief under Article 122 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 whether filed with or without leave of court or a second or subsequent petition for relief from judgment under Section 2-1401 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n(e) Nothing in Public Act 90-592 or 90-593 affects the validity of Public Act 89-404.\n\n\n(f) Whenever the Department is to release any inmate who has been convicted of a violation of an order of protection under Section 12-3.4 or 12-30 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, earlier than it otherwise would because of a grant of sentence credit, the Department, as a condition of release, shall require that the person, upon release, be placed under electronic surveillance as provided in Section 5-8A-7 of this Code.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-440, eff. 1-1-20; 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-28, eff. 6-25-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-784, eff. 5-13-22.)\n\n\n(Text of Section from P.A. 102-1100)"

Calculation of this county program credit shall be done at sentencing as provided in Section 5-4.5-100 of this Code and shall be included in the sentencing order. The rules and regulations shall also provide that sentence credit may be provided to an inmate who is in compliance with programming requirements in an adult transition center.\n\n\n(B) The Department shall award sentence credit under this paragraph (4) accumulated prior to January 1, 2020 (the effective date of Public Act 101-440) in an amount specified in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (4) to an inmate serving a sentence for an offense committed prior to June 19, 1998, if the Department determines that the inmate is entitled to this sentence credit, based upon:\n\n\n(i) documentation provided by the Department that the inmate engaged in any full-time substance abuse programs, correctional industry assignments, educational programs, behavior modification programs, life skills courses, or re-entry planning provided by the Department under this paragraph (4) and satisfactorily completed the assigned program as determined by the standards of the Department during the inmate’s current term of incarceration; or\n\n\n(ii) the inmate’s own testimony in the form of an affidavit or documentation, or a third party’s documentation or testimony in the form of an affidavit that the inmate likely engaged in any full-time substance abuse programs, correctional industry assignments, educational programs, behavior modification programs, life skills courses, or re-entry planning provided by the Department under paragraph (4) and satisfactorily completed the assigned program as determined by the standards of the Department during the inmate’s current term of incarceration.\n\n\n(C) If the inmate can provide documentation that he or she is entitled to sentence credit under subparagraph (B) in excess of 45 days of participation in those programs, the inmate shall receive 90 days of sentence credit. If the inmate cannot provide documentation of more than 45 days of participation in those programs, the inmate shall receive 45 days of sentence credit. In the event of a disagreement between the Department and the inmate as to the amount of credit accumulated under subparagraph (B), if the Department provides documented proof of a lesser amount of days of participation in those programs, that proof shall control. If the Department provides no documentary proof, the inmate’s proof as set forth in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) shall control as to the amount of sentence credit provided.\n\n\n(D) If the inmate has been convicted of a sex offense as defined in Section 2 of the Sex Offender Registration Act, sentencing credits under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (4) shall be awarded by the Department only if the conditions set forth in paragraph (4.6) of subsection (a) are satisfied. No inmate serving a term of natural life imprisonment shall receive sentence credit under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (4).\n\n\nEducational, vocational, substance abuse, behavior modification programs, life skills courses, re-entry planning, and correctional industry programs under which sentence credit may be earned under this paragraph (4) and paragraph (4.1) of this subsection (a) shall be evaluated by the Department on the basis of documented standards. The Department shall report the results of these evaluations to the Governor and the General Assembly by September 30th of each year. The reports shall include data relating to the recidivism rate among program participants.\n\n\nAvailability of these programs shall be subject to the limits of fiscal resources appropriated by the General Assembly for these purposes. Eligible inmates who are denied immediate admission shall be placed on a waiting list under criteria established by the Department. The rules and regulations shall provide that a prisoner who has been placed on a waiting list but is transferred for non-disciplinary reasons before beginning a program shall receive priority placement on the waitlist for appropriate programs at the new facility. The inability of any inmate to become engaged in any such programs by reason of insufficient program resources or for any other reason established under the rules and regulations of the Department shall not be deemed a cause of action under which the Department or any employee or agent of the Department shall be liable for damages to the inmate. The rules and regulations shall provide that a prisoner who begins an educational, vocational, substance abuse, work-release programs or activities in accordance with Article 13 of Chapter III of this Code, behavior modification program, life skills course, re-entry planning, or correctional industry programs but is unable to complete the program due to illness, disability, transfer, lockdown, or another reason outside of the prisoner’s control shall receive prorated sentence credits for the days in which the prisoner did participate.\n\n\n(4.1) Except as provided in paragraph (4.7) of this subsection (a), the rules and regulations shall also provide that an additional 90 days of sentence credit shall be awarded to any prisoner who passes high school equivalency testing while the prisoner is committed to the Department of Corrections. The sentence credit awarded under this paragraph (4.1) shall be in addition to, and shall not affect, the award of sentence credit under any other paragraph of this Section, but shall also be pursuant to the guidelines and restrictions set forth in paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of this Section. The sentence credit provided for in this paragraph shall be available only to those prisoners who have not previously earned a high school diploma or a State of Illinois High School Diploma. If, after an award of the high school equivalency testing sentence credit has been made, the Department determines that the prisoner was not eligible, then the award shall be revoked. The Department may also award 90 days of sentence credit to any committed person who passed high school equivalency testing while he or she was held in pre-trial detention prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections. Except as provided in paragraph (4.7) of this subsection (a), the rules and regulations shall provide that an additional 120 days of sentence credit shall be awarded to any prisoner who obtains an associate degree while the prisoner is committed to the Department of Corrections, regardless of the date that the associate degree was obtained, including if prior to July 1, 2021 (the effective date of Public Act 101-652). The sentence credit awarded under this paragraph (4.1) shall be in addition to, and shall not affect, the award of sentence credit under any other paragraph of this Section, but shall also be under the guidelines and restrictions set forth in paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of this Section. The sentence credit provided for in this paragraph (4.1) shall be available only to those prisoners who have not previously earned an associate degree prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections. If, after an award of the associate degree sentence credit has been made and the Department determines that the prisoner was not eligible, then the award shall be revoked. The Department may also award 120 days of sentence credit to any committed person who earned an associate degree while he or she was held in pre-trial detention prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections.\n\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (4.7) of this subsection (a), the rules and regulations shall provide that an additional 180 days of sentence credit shall be awarded to any prisoner who obtains a bachelor’s degree while the prisoner is committed to the Department of Corrections. The sentence credit awarded under this paragraph (4.1) shall be in addition to, and shall not affect, the award of sentence credit under any other paragraph of this Section, but shall also be under the guidelines and restrictions set forth in paragraph (4) of this subsection (a). The sentence credit provided for in this paragraph shall be available only to those prisoners who have not earned a bachelor’s degree prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections. If, after an award of the bachelor’s degree sentence credit has been made, the Department determines that the prisoner was not eligible, then the award shall be revoked. The Department may also award 180 days of sentence credit to any committed person who earned a bachelor’s degree while he or she was held in pre-trial detention prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections.\n\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (4.7) of this subsection (a), the rules and regulations shall provide that an additional 180 days of sentence credit shall be awarded to any prisoner who obtains a master’s or professional degree while the prisoner is committed to the Department of Corrections. The sentence credit awarded under this paragraph (4.1) shall be in addition to, and shall not affect, the award of sentence credit under any other paragraph of this Section, but shall also be under the guidelines and restrictions set forth in paragraph (4) of this subsection (a). The sentence credit provided for in this paragraph shall be available only to those prisoners who have not previously earned a master’s or professional degree prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections. If, after an award of the master’s or professional degree sentence credit has been made, the Department determines that the prisoner was not eligible, then the award shall be revoked. The Department may also award 180 days of sentence credit to any committed person who earned a master’s or professional degree while he or she was held in pre-trial detention prior to the current commitment to the Department of Corrections.\n\n\n(4.2) The rules and regulations shall also provide that any prisoner engaged in self-improvement programs, volunteer work, or work assignments that are not otherwise eligible activities under paragraph (4), shall receive up to 0.5 days of sentence credit for each day in which the prisoner is engaged in activities described in this paragraph.\n\n\n(4.5) The rules and regulations on sentence credit shall also provide that when the court’s sentencing order recommends a prisoner for substance abuse treatment and the crime was committed on or after September 1, 2003 (the effective date of Public Act 93-354), the prisoner shall receive no sentence credit awarded under clause (3) of this subsection (a) unless he or she participates in and completes a substance abuse treatment program. The Director may waive the requirement to participate in or complete a substance abuse treatment program in specific instances if the prisoner is not a good candidate for a substance abuse treatment program for medical, programming, or operational reasons. Availability of substance abuse treatment shall be subject to the limits of fiscal resources appropriated by the General Assembly for these purposes. If treatment is not available and the requirement to participate and complete the treatment has not been waived by the Director, the prisoner shall be placed on a waiting list under criteria established by the Department. The Director may allow a prisoner placed on a waiting list to participate in and complete a substance abuse education class or attend substance abuse self-help meetings in lieu of a substance abuse treatment program. A prisoner on a waiting list who is not placed in a substance abuse program prior to release may be eligible for a waiver and receive sentence credit under clause (3) of this subsection (a) at the discretion of the Director.\n\n\n(4.6) The rules and regulations on sentence credit shall also provide that a prisoner who has been convicted of a sex offense as defined in Section 2 of the Sex Offender Registration Act shall receive no sentence credit unless he or she either has successfully completed or is participating in sex offender treatment as defined by the Sex Offender Management Board. However, prisoners who are waiting to receive treatment, but who are unable to do so due solely to the lack of resources on the part of the Department, may, at the Director’s sole discretion, be awarded sentence credit at a rate as the Director shall determine.\n\n\n(4.7) On or after January 1, 2018 (the effective date of Public Act 100-3), sentence credit under paragraph (3), (4), or (4.1) of this subsection (a) may be awarded to a prisoner who is serving a sentence for an offense described in paragraph (2), (2.3), (2.4), (2.5), or (2.6) for credit earned on or after January 1, 2018 (the effective date of Public Act 100-3); provided, the award of the credits under this paragraph (4.7) shall not reduce the sentence of the prisoner to less than the following amounts:\n\n\n(i) 85% of his or her sentence if the prisoner is required to serve 85% of his or her sentence; or\n\n\n(ii) 60% of his or her sentence if the prisoner is required to serve 75% of his or her sentence, except if the prisoner is serving a sentence for gunrunning his or her sentence shall not be reduced to less than 75%.\n\n\n(iii) 100% of his or her sentence if the prisoner is required to serve 100% of his or her sentence.\n\n\n(5) Whenever the Department is to release any inmate earlier than it otherwise would because of a grant of earned sentence credit under paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this Section given at any time during the term, the Department shall give reasonable notice of the impending release not less than 14 days prior to the date of the release to the State’s Attorney of the county where the prosecution of the inmate took place, and if applicable, the State’s Attorney of the county into which the inmate will be released. The Department must also make identification information and a recent photo of the inmate being released accessible on the Internet by means of a hyperlink labeled “Community Notification of Inmate Early Release” on the Department’s World Wide Web homepage. The identification information shall include the inmate’s: name, any known alias, date of birth, physical characteristics, commitment offense, and county where conviction was imposed. The identification information shall be placed on the website within 3 days of the inmate’s release and the information may not be removed until either: completion of the first year of mandatory supervised release or return of the inmate to custody of the Department.\n\n\n(b) Whenever a person is or has been committed under several convictions, with separate sentences, the sentences shall be construed under Section 5-8-4 in granting and forfeiting of sentence credit.\n\n\n(c) (1) The Department shall prescribe rules and regulations for revoking sentence credit, including revoking sentence credit awarded under paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this Section. The Department shall prescribe rules and regulations establishing and requiring the use of a sanctions matrix for revoking sentence credit. The Department shall prescribe rules and regulations for suspending or reducing the rate of accumulation of sentence credit for specific rule violations, during imprisonment. These rules and regulations shall provide that no inmate may be penalized more than one year of sentence credit for any one infraction.\n\n\n(2) When the Department seeks to revoke, suspend, or reduce the rate of accumulation of any sentence credits for an alleged infraction of its rules, it shall bring charges therefor against the prisoner sought to be so deprived of sentence credits before the Prisoner Review Board as provided in subparagraph (a)(4) of Section 3-3-2 of this Code, if the amount of credit at issue exceeds 30 days, whether from one infraction or cumulatively from multiple infractions arising out of a single event, or when, during any 12-month period, the cumulative amount of credit revoked exceeds 30 days except where the infraction is committed or discovered within 60 days of scheduled release. In those cases, the Department of Corrections may revoke up to 30 days of sentence credit. The Board may subsequently approve the revocation of additional sentence credit, if the Department seeks to revoke sentence credit in excess of 30 days. However, the Board shall not be empowered to review the Department’s decision with respect to the loss of 30 days of sentence credit within any calendar year for any prisoner or to increase any penalty beyond the length requested by the Department.\n\n\n(3) The Director of the Department of Corrections, in appropriate cases, may restore sentence credits which have been revoked, suspended, or reduced. The Department shall prescribe rules and regulations governing the restoration of sentence credits. These rules and regulations shall provide for the automatic restoration of sentence credits following a period in which the prisoner maintains a record without a disciplinary violation.\n\n\nNothing contained in this Section shall prohibit the Prisoner Review Board from ordering, pursuant to Section 3-3-9(a)(3)(i)(B), that a prisoner serve up to one year of the sentence imposed by the court that was not served due to the accumulation of sentence credit.\n\n\n(d) If a lawsuit is filed by a prisoner in an Illinois or federal court against the State, the Department of Corrections, or the Prisoner Review Board, or against any of their officers or employees, and the court makes a specific finding that a pleading, motion, or other paper filed by the prisoner is frivolous, the Department of Corrections shall conduct a hearing to revoke up to 180 days of sentence credit by bringing charges against the prisoner sought to be deprived of the sentence credits before the Prisoner Review Board as provided in subparagraph (a)(8) of Section 3-3-2 of this Code. If the prisoner has not accumulated 180 days of sentence credit at the time of the finding, then the Prisoner Review Board may revoke all sentence credit accumulated by the prisoner.\n\n\nFor purposes of this subsection (d):\n\n\n(1) “Frivolous” means that a pleading, motion, or other filing which purports to be a legal document filed by a prisoner in his or her lawsuit meets any or all of the following criteria:\n\n\n(A) it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact;\n\n\n(B) it is being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation;\n\n\n(C) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;\n\n\n(D) the allegations and other factual contentions do not have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are not likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; or\n\n\n(E) the denials of factual contentions are not warranted on the evidence, or if specifically so identified, are not reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.\n\n\n(2) “Lawsuit” means a motion pursuant to Section 116-3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, a habeas corpus action under Article X of the Code of Civil Procedure or under federal law (28 U.S.C. 2254), a petition for claim under the Court of Claims Act, an action under the federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 1983), or a second or subsequent petition for post-conviction relief under Article 122 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 whether filed with or without leave of court or a second or subsequent petition for relief from judgment under Section 2-1401 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n(e) Nothing in Public Act 90-592 or 90-593 affects the validity of Public Act 89-404.\n\n\n(f) Whenever the Department is to release any inmate who has been convicted of a violation of an order of protection under Section 12-3.4 or 12-30 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, earlier than it otherwise would because of a grant of sentence credit, the Department, as a condition of release, shall require that the person, upon release, be placed under electronic surveillance as provided in Section 5-8A-7 of this Code.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-440, eff. 1-1-20; 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-28, eff. 6-25-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-1100, eff. 1-1-23.)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/3-6-3.1)"

    "text": "Article I\nThe party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.\nAs used in this agreement:\n(a) “State” shall mean a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n(b) “Sending state” shall mean a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that he initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to Article III hereof or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to Article IV hereof.\n(c) “Receiving state” shall mean the state in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint pursuant to Article III or Article IV hereof.\n(a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within 180 days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer’s jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint: provided that for a good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.\n(b) The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of him, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.\n(c) The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based.\n(d) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner’s request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner’s written notice, request, and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\n(e) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of paragraph (d) hereof, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him, after completion of his term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.\n(f) Escape from custody by the prisoner subsequent to his execution of the request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall void the request.\n(a) The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with Article V (a) hereof upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated: provided that the court having jurisdiction of such indictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request: and provided further that there shall be a period of 30 days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request be honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.\n(b) Upon receipt of the officer’s written request as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor.\n(c) In respect of any proceeding made possible by this Article, trial shall be commenced within 120 days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.\n(d) Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery.\n(e) If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner’s being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to Article V (e) hereof, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\n(a) In response to a request made under Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of such prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where such indictment, information or complaint is pending against such person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner’s presence in federal custody at the place for trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.\n(b) The officer or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand:\n(1) Proper identification and evidence of his authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given.\n(2) A duly certified copy of the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made.\n(c) If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of said person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.\n(d) The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.\n(e) At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.\n(f) During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.\n(g) For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and any escape from the temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law.\n(h) From the time that a party state receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping and returning the prisoner. The provisions of this paragraph shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.\n(a) In determining the duration and expiration dates of the time periods provided in Articles III and IV of this agreement, the running of said time periods shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter.\n(b) No provision of this agreement, and no remedy made available by this agreement, shall apply to any person who is adjudged to be mentally ill.\nEach state party to this agreement shall designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other party states, shall promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this agreement, and who shall provide, within and without the state, information necessary to the effective operation of this agreement.\nThis agreement shall enter into full force and effect as to a party state when such state has enacted the same into law. A state party to this agreement may withdraw herefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not affect the status of any proceedings already initiated by inmates or by state officers at the time such withdrawal takes effect, nor shall it affect their rights in respect thereof.\nThis agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party hereto, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n(b) “Appropriate court” as used in this Section with reference to the courts of this State means circuit courts.\n(c) All courts, departments, agencies, officers and employees of this State and its political subdivisions are hereby directed to enforce the Agreement on Detainers and to cooperate with one another and with other party states in enforcing the agreement and effectuating its purpose.\n(d) Section 3-6-4 shall apply to offenders while in the custody of another state under this Section.\n(e) It shall be lawful and mandatory upon the chief administrative officer or other official in charge of a penal or correctional institution in this State to give over the person of any inmate thereof whenever so required by the operation of the Agreement on Detainers.\n(f) The Director of the Department of Corrections shall be the officer designated under Article VII of the Agreement on Detainers.\n(g) Copies of this act shall, upon its approval, be transmitted to the governor of each state, the attorney general and the administrator of general services of the United States, and the council of State Governments.\n(Source: P.A. 77-2097.)"

The committed person shall be assigned to an institution or facility in so far as practicable in accordance with the social evaluation.

The Department shall develop the informational materials in consultation with the Department of Public Health. At the same time, the Department also must offer the committed person the option of being tested, with no copayment, for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Pre-test information shall be provided to the committed person and informed consent obtained as required in subsection (q) of Section 3 and Section 5 of the AIDS Confidentiality Act. The Department may conduct opt-out HIV testing as defined in Section 4 of the AIDS Confidentiality Act. If the Department conducts opt-out HIV testing, the Department shall place signs in English, Spanish and other languages as needed in multiple, highly visible locations in the area where HIV testing is conducted informing inmates that they will be tested for HIV unless they refuse, and refusal or acceptance of testing shall be documented in the inmate’s medical record. The Department shall follow procedures established by the Department of Public Health to conduct HIV testing and testing to confirm positive HIV test results. All testing must be conducted by medical personnel, but pre-test and other information may be provided by committed persons who have received appropriate training. The Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Health, shall develop a plan that complies with the AIDS Confidentiality Act to deliver confidentially all positive or negative HIV test results to inmates or former inmates. Nothing in this Section shall require the Department to offer HIV testing to an inmate who is known to be infected with HIV, or who has been tested for HIV within the previous 180 days and whose documented HIV test result is available to the Department electronically. The testing provided under this subsection (d) shall consist of a test approved by the Illinois Department of Public Health to determine the presence of HIV infection, based upon recommendations of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

At the same time, the Department of Juvenile Justice also must offer the person the option of being tested, at no charge to the person, for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Pre-test information shall be provided to the committed person and informed consent obtained as required in subsection (q) of Section 3 and Section 5 of the AIDS Confidentiality Act. The Department of Juvenile Justice may conduct opt-out HIV testing as defined in Section 4 of the AIDS Confidentiality Act. If the Department conducts opt-out HIV testing, the Department shall place signs in English, Spanish and other languages as needed in multiple, highly visible locations in the area where HIV testing is conducted informing inmates that they will be tested for HIV unless they refuse, and refusal or acceptance of testing shall be documented in the inmate’s medical record. The Department shall follow procedures established by the Department of Public Health to conduct HIV testing and testing to confirm positive HIV test results. All testing must be conducted by medical personnel, but pre-test and other information may be provided by committed persons who have received appropriate training. The Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Health, shall develop a plan that complies with the AIDS Confidentiality Act to deliver confidentially all positive or negative HIV test results to inmates or former inmates. Nothing in this Section shall require the Department to offer HIV testing to an inmate who is known to be infected with HIV, or who has been tested for HIV within the previous 180 days and whose documented HIV test result is available to the Department electronically. The testing provided under this subsection (a-5) shall consist of a test approved by the Illinois Department of Public Health to determine the presence of HIV infection, based upon recommendations of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If the test result is positive, a reliable supplemental test based upon recommendations of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shall be administered.\n\n\nAlso, upon the admission of a person committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice, the Department of Juvenile Justice must inform the person of the Department’s obligation to provide the person with medical care.\n\n\n(b) Based on its examination, the Department of Juvenile Justice may exercise the following powers in developing a treatment program of any person committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice:\n\n\n(1) Require participation by him in vocational, physical, educational and corrective training and activities to return him to the community.\n\n\n(2) Place him in any institution or facility of the Department of Juvenile Justice.\n\n\n(3) Order replacement or referral to the Parole and Pardon Board as often as it deems desirable. The Department of Juvenile Justice shall refer the person to the Parole and Pardon Board as required under Section 3-3-4.\n\n\n(4) Enter into agreements with the Secretary of Human Services and the Director of Children and Family Services, with courts having probation officers, and with private agencies or institutions for separate care or special treatment of persons subject to the control of the Department of Juvenile Justice.\n\n\n(c) The Department of Juvenile Justice shall make periodic reexamination of all persons under the control of the Department of Juvenile Justice to determine whether existing orders in individual cases should be modified or continued. This examination shall be made with respect to every person at least once annually.\n\n\n(d) A record of the treatment decision, including any modification thereof and the reason therefor, shall be part of the committed person’s master record file.\n\n\n(e) The Department of Juvenile Justice shall by regular mail and telephone or electronic message notify the parent, guardian, or nearest relative of any person committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice of his or her physical location and any change of his or her physical location.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 100-19, eff. 1-1-18; 100-700, eff. 8-3-18; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19.)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/3-10-3) (from Ch. 38, par. 1003-10-3)"

    "text": "Sec. 5-2-4. Proceedings after acquittal by reason of insanity.\n\n(a) After a finding or verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity under Sections 104-25, 115-3, or 115-4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, the defendant shall be ordered to the Department of Human Services for an evaluation as to whether he is in need of mental health services. The order shall specify whether the evaluation shall be conducted on an inpatient or outpatient basis. If the evaluation is to be conducted on an inpatient basis, the defendant shall be placed in a secure setting. With the court order for evaluation shall be sent a copy of the arrest report, criminal charges, arrest record, jail record, any report prepared under Section 115-6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, and any statement prepared under Section 6 of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act. The clerk of the circuit court shall transmit this information to the Department within 5 days. If the court orders that the evaluation be done on an inpatient basis, the Department shall evaluate the defendant to determine to which secure facility the defendant shall be transported and, within 20 days of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit court of the placement court order, notify the sheriff of the designated facility. Upon receipt of that notice, the sheriff shall promptly transport the defendant to the designated facility. During the period of time required to determine the appropriate placement, the defendant shall remain in jail. If, within 20 days of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit court of the placement court order, the Department fails to notify the sheriff of the identity of the facility to which the defendant shall be transported, the sheriff shall contact a designated person within the Department to inquire about when a placement will become available at the designated facility and bed availability at other facilities. If, within 20 days of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit court of the placement court order, the Department fails to notify the sheriff of the identity of the facility to which the defendant shall be transported, the sheriff shall notify the Department of its intent to transfer the defendant to the nearest secure mental health facility operated by the Department and inquire as to the status of the placement evaluation and availability for admission to the facility operated by the Department by contacting a designated person within the Department. The Department shall respond to the sheriff within 2 business days of the notice and inquiry by the sheriff seeking the transfer and the Department shall provide the sheriff with the status of the placement evaluation, information on bed and placement availability, and an estimated date of admission for the defendant and any changes to that estimated date of admission. If the Department notifies the sheriff during the 2 business day period of a facility operated by the Department with placement availability, the sheriff shall promptly transport the defendant to that facility. Individualized placement evaluations by the Department of Human Services determine the most appropriate setting for forensic treatment based upon a number of factors including mental health diagnosis, proximity to surviving victims, security need, age, gender, and proximity to family.\n\n\nThe Department shall provide the Court with a report of its evaluation within 30 days of the date of this order. The Court shall hold a hearing as provided under the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code to determine if the individual is: (a) in need of mental health services on an inpatient basis; (b) in need of mental health services on an outpatient basis; (c) a person not in need of mental health services. The court shall afford the victim the opportunity to make a written or oral statement as guaranteed by Article I, Section 8.1 of the Illinois Constitution and Section 6 of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act. The court shall allow a victim to make an oral statement if the victim is present in the courtroom and requests to make an oral statement. An oral statement includes the victim or a representative of the victim reading the written statement. The court may allow persons impacted by the crime who are not victims under subsection (a) of Section 3 of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act to present an oral or written statement. A victim and any person making an oral statement shall not be put under oath or subject to cross-examination. The court shall consider any statement presented along with all other appropriate factors in determining the sentence of the defendant or disposition of the juvenile. All statements shall become part of the record of the court.\n\n\nIf the defendant is found to be in need of mental health services on an inpatient care basis, the Court shall order the defendant to the Department of Human Services. The defendant shall be placed in a secure setting. Such defendants placed in a secure setting shall not be permitted outside the facility’s housing unit unless escorted or accompanied by personnel of the Department of Human Services or with the prior approval of the Court for unsupervised on-grounds privileges as provided herein. Any defendant placed in a secure setting pursuant to this Section, transported to court hearings or other necessary appointments off facility grounds by personnel of the Department of Human Services, shall be placed in security devices or otherwise secured during the period of transportation to assure secure transport of the defendant and the safety of Department of Human Services personnel and others. These security measures shall not constitute restraint as defined in the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code. If the defendant is found to be in need of mental health services, but not on an inpatient care basis, the Court shall conditionally release the defendant, under such conditions as set forth in this Section as will reasonably assure the defendant’s satisfactory progress and participation in treatment or rehabilitation and the safety of the defendant, the victim, the victim’s family members, and others. If the Court finds the person not in need of mental health services, then the Court shall order the defendant discharged from custody.\n\n\n(a-1) Definitions. For the purposes of this Section:\n\n\n(A) (Blank).\n\n\n(B) “In need of mental health services on an inpatient basis” means: a defendant who has been found not guilty by reason of insanity but who, due to mental illness, is reasonably expected to inflict serious physical harm upon himself or another and who would benefit from inpatient care or is in need of inpatient care.\n\n\n(C) “In need of mental health services on an outpatient basis” means: a defendant who has been found not guilty by reason of insanity who is not in need of mental health services on an inpatient basis, but is in need of outpatient care, drug and/or alcohol rehabilitation programs, community adjustment programs, individual, group, or family therapy, or chemotherapy.\n\n\n(D) “Conditional Release” means: the release from either the custody of the Department of Human Services or the custody of the Court of a person who has been found not guilty by reason of insanity under such conditions as the Court may impose which reasonably assure the defendant’s satisfactory progress in treatment or habilitation and the safety of the defendant, the victim, the victim’s family, and others. The Court shall consider such terms and conditions which may include, but need not be limited to, outpatient care, alcoholic and drug rehabilitation programs, community adjustment programs, individual, group, family, and chemotherapy, random testing to ensure the defendant’s timely and continuous taking of any medicines prescribed to control or manage his or her conduct or mental state, and periodic checks with the legal authorities and/or the Department of Human Services. The Court may order as a condition of conditional release that the defendant not contact the victim of the offense that resulted in the finding or verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity or any other person. The Court may order the Department of Human Services to provide care to any person conditionally released under this Section. The Department may contract with any public or private agency in order to discharge any responsibilities imposed under this Section. The Department shall monitor the provision of services to persons conditionally released under this Section and provide periodic reports to the Court concerning the services and the condition of the defendant. Whenever a person is conditionally released pursuant to this Section, the State’s Attorney for the county in which the hearing is held shall designate in writing the name, telephone number, and address of a person employed by him or her who shall be notified in the event that either the reporting agency or the Department decides that the conditional release of the defendant should be revoked or modified pursuant to subsection (i) of this Section. Such conditional release shall be for a period of five years. However, the defendant, the person or facility rendering the treatment, therapy, program or outpatient care, the Department, or the State’s Attorney may petition the Court for an extension of the conditional release period for an additional 5 years. Upon receipt of such a petition, the Court shall hold a hearing consistent with the provisions of paragraph (a), this paragraph (a-1), and paragraph (f) of this Section, shall determine whether the defendant should continue to be subject to the terms of conditional release, and shall enter an order either extending the defendant’s period of conditional release for an additional 5-year period or discharging the defendant. Additional 5-year periods of conditional release may be ordered following a hearing as provided in this Section. However, in no event shall the defendant’s period of conditional release continue beyond the maximum period of commitment ordered by the Court pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. These provisions for extension of conditional release shall only apply to defendants conditionally released on or after August 8, 2003. However, the extension provisions of Public Act 83-1449 apply only to defendants charged with a forcible felony.\n\n\n(E) “Facility director” means the chief officer of a mental health or developmental disabilities facility or his or her designee or the supervisor of a program of treatment or habilitation or his or her designee. “Designee” may include a physician, clinical psychologist, social worker, nurse, or clinical professional counselor.\n\n\n(b) If the Court finds the defendant in need of mental health services on an inpatient basis, the admission, detention, care, treatment or habilitation, treatment plans, review proceedings, including review of treatment and treatment plans, and discharge of the defendant after such order shall be under the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code, except that the initial order for admission of a defendant acquitted of a felony by reason of insanity shall be for an indefinite period of time. Such period of commitment shall not exceed the maximum length of time that the defendant would have been required to serve, less credit for good behavior as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Unified Code of Corrections, before becoming eligible for release had he been convicted of and received the maximum sentence for the most serious crime for which he has been acquitted by reason of insanity. The Court shall determine the maximum period of commitment by an appropriate order. During this period of time, the defendant shall not be permitted to be in the community in any manner, including, but not limited to, off-grounds privileges, with or without escort by personnel of the Department of Human Services, unsupervised on-grounds privileges, discharge or conditional or temporary release, except by a plan as provided in this Section. In no event shall a defendant’s continued unauthorized absence be a basis for discharge. Not more than 30 days after admission and every 90 days thereafter so long as the initial order remains in effect, the facility director shall file a treatment plan report in writing with the court and forward a copy of the treatment plan report to the clerk of the court, the State’s Attorney, and the defendant’s attorney, if the defendant is represented by counsel, or to a person authorized by the defendant under the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Confidentiality Act to be sent a copy of the report. The report shall include an opinion as to whether the defendant is currently in need of mental health services on an inpatient basis or in need of mental health services on an outpatient basis. The report shall also summarize the basis for those findings and provide a current summary of the following items from the treatment plan: (1) an assessment of the defendant’s treatment needs, (2) a description of the services recommended for treatment, (3) the goals of each type of element of service, (4) an anticipated timetable for the accomplishment of the goals, and (5) a designation of the qualified professional responsible for the implementation of the plan. The report may also include unsupervised on-grounds privileges, off-grounds privileges (with or without escort by personnel of the Department of Human Services), home visits and participation in work programs, but only where such privileges have been approved by specific court order, which order may include such conditions on the defendant as the Court may deem appropriate and necessary to reasonably assure the defendant’s satisfactory progress in treatment and the safety of the defendant and others.\n\n\n(c) Every defendant acquitted of a felony by reason of insanity and subsequently found to be in need of mental health services shall be represented by counsel in all proceedings under this Section and under the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code.\n\n\n(1) The Court shall appoint as counsel the public defender or an attorney licensed by this State.\n\n\n(2) Upon filing with the Court of a verified statement of legal services rendered by the private attorney appointed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Court shall determine a reasonable fee for such services. If the defendant is unable to pay the fee, the Court shall enter an order upon the State to pay the entire fee or such amount as the defendant is unable to pay from funds appropriated by the General Assembly for that purpose.\n\n\n(d) When the facility director determines that:\n\n\n(1) the defendant is no longer in need of mental health services on an inpatient basis; and\n\n\n(2) the defendant may be conditionally released because he or she is still in need of mental health services or that the defendant may be discharged as not in need of any mental health services;\n\n\nthe facility director shall give written notice to the Court, State’s Attorney and defense attorney. Such notice shall set forth in detail the basis for the recommendation of the facility director, and specify clearly the recommendations, if any, of the facility director, concerning conditional release. Any recommendation for conditional release shall include an evaluation of the defendant’s need for psychotropic medication, what provisions should be made, if any, to ensure that the defendant will continue to receive psychotropic medication following discharge, and what provisions should be made to assure the safety of the defendant and others in the event the defendant is no longer receiving psychotropic medication. Within 30 days of the notification by the facility director, the Court shall set a hearing and make a finding as to whether the defendant is:\n\n\n(i) (blank); or\n\n\n(ii) in need of mental health services in the form of inpatient care; or\n\n\n(iii) in need of mental health services but not subject to inpatient care; or\n\n\n(iv) no longer in need of mental health services; or\n\n\n(v) (blank).\n\n\nA crime victim shall be allowed to present an oral and written statement. The court shall allow a victim to make an oral statement if the victim is present in the courtroom and requests to make an oral statement. An oral statement includes the victim or a representative of the victim reading the written statement. A victim and any person making an oral statement shall not be put under oath or subject to cross-examination. All statements shall become part of the record of the court.\n\n\nUpon finding by the Court, the Court shall enter its findings and such appropriate order as provided in subsections (a) and (a-1) of this Section.\n\n\n(e) A defendant admitted pursuant to this Section, or any person on his behalf, may file a petition for treatment plan review or discharge or conditional release under the standards of this Section in the Court which rendered the verdict. Upon receipt of a petition for treatment plan review or discharge or conditional release, the Court shall set a hearing to be held within 120 days. Thereafter, no new petition may be filed for 180 days without leave of the Court.\n\n\n(f) The Court shall direct that notice of the time and place of the hearing be served upon the defendant, the facility director, the State’s Attorney, and the defendant’s attorney. If requested by either the State or the defense or if the Court feels it is appropriate, an impartial examination of the defendant by a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist as defined in Section 1-103 of the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code who is not in the employ of the Department of Human Services shall be ordered, and the report considered at the time of the hearing.\n\n\n(g) The findings of the Court shall be established by clear and convincing evidence. The burden of proof and the burden of going forth with the evidence rest with the defendant or any person on the defendant’s behalf when a hearing is held to review a petition filed by or on behalf of the defendant. The evidence shall be presented in open Court with the right of confrontation and cross-examination. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to:\n\n\n(1) whether the defendant appreciates the harm caused by the defendant to others and the community by his or her prior conduct that resulted in the finding of not guilty by reason of insanity;\n\n\n(2) Whether the person appreciates the criminality of conduct similar to the conduct for which he or she was originally charged in this matter;\n\n\n(3) the current state of the defendant’s illness;\n\n\n(4) what, if any, medications the defendant is taking to control his or her mental illness;\n\n\n(5) what, if any, adverse physical side effects the medication has on the defendant;\n\n\n(6) the length of time it would take for the defendant’s mental health to deteriorate if the defendant stopped taking prescribed medication;\n\n\n(7) the defendant’s history or potential for alcohol and drug abuse;\n\n\n(8) the defendant’s past criminal history;\n\n\n(9) any specialized physical or medical needs of the defendant;\n\n\n(10) any family participation or involvement expected upon release and what is the willingness and ability of the family to participate or be involved;\n\n\n(11) the defendant’s potential to be a danger to himself, herself, or others;\n\n\n(11.5) a written or oral statement made by the victim; and\n\n\n(12) any other factor or factors the Court deems appropriate.\n\n\n(h) Before the court orders that the defendant be discharged or conditionally released, it shall order the facility director to establish a discharge plan that includes a plan for the defendant’s shelter, support, and medication. If appropriate, the court shall order that the facility director establish a program to train the defendant in self-medication under standards established by the Department of Human Services. If the Court finds, consistent with the provisions of this Section, that the defendant is no longer in need of mental health services it shall order the facility director to discharge the defendant. If the Court finds, consistent with the provisions of this Section, that the defendant is in need of mental health services, and no longer in need of inpatient care, it shall order the facility director to release the defendant under such conditions as the Court deems appropriate and as provided by this Section. Such conditional release shall be imposed for a period of 5 years as provided in paragraph (D) of subsection (a-1) and shall be subject to later modification by the Court as provided by this Section. If the Court finds consistent with the provisions in this Section that the defendant is in need of mental health services on an inpatient basis, it shall order the facility director not to discharge or release the defendant in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.\n\n\n(i) If within the period of the defendant’s conditional release the State’s Attorney determines that the defendant has not fulfilled the conditions of his or her release, the State’s Attorney may petition the Court to revoke or modify the conditional release of the defendant. Upon the filing of such petition the defendant may be remanded to the custody of the Department, or to any other mental health facility designated by the Department, pending the resolution of the petition. Nothing in this Section shall prevent the emergency admission of a defendant pursuant to Article VI of Chapter III of the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code or the voluntary admission of the defendant pursuant to Article IV of Chapter III of the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code. If the Court determines, after hearing evidence, that the defendant has not fulfilled the conditions of release, the Court shall order a hearing to be held consistent with the provisions of paragraph (f) and (g) of this Section. At such hearing, if the Court finds that the defendant is in need of mental health services on an inpatient basis, it shall enter an order remanding him or her to the Department of Human Services or other facility. If the defendant is remanded to the Department of Human Services, he or she shall be placed in a secure setting unless the Court determines that there are compelling reasons that such placement is not necessary. If the Court finds that the defendant continues to be in need of mental health services but not on an inpatient basis, it may modify the conditions of the original release in order to reasonably assure the defendant’s satisfactory progress in treatment and his or her safety and the safety of others in accordance with the standards established in paragraph (D) of subsection (a-1). Nothing in this Section shall limit a Court’s contempt powers or any other powers of a Court.\n\n\n(j) An order of admission under this Section does not affect the remedy of habeas corpus.\n\n\n(k) In the event of a conflict between this Section and the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code or the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Confidentiality Act, the provisions of this Section shall govern.\n\n\n(l) Public Act 90-593 shall apply to all persons who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity and who are presently committed to the Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities (now the Department of Human Services).\n\n\n(m) The Clerk of the Court shall transmit a certified copy of the order of discharge or conditional release to the Department of Human Services, to the sheriff of the county from which the defendant was admitted, to the Illinois State Police, to the proper law enforcement agency for the municipality where the offense took place, and to the sheriff of the county into which the defendant is conditionally discharged. The Illinois State Police shall maintain a centralized record of discharged or conditionally released defendants while they are under court supervision for access and use of appropriate law enforcement agencies.\n\n\n(n) The provisions in this Section which allow a crime victim to make a written and oral statement do not apply if the defendant was under 18 years of age at the time the offense was committed.\n\n\n(o) If any provision of this Section or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity of that provision does not affect any other provision or application of this Section that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-81, eff. 7-12-19; 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21.)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-2-5) (from Ch. 38, par. 1005-2-5)"

    "text": "Sec. 5-4-1. Sentencing hearing.\n\n(a) Except when the death penalty is sought under hearing procedures otherwise specified, after a determination of guilt, a hearing shall be held to impose the sentence. However, prior to the imposition of sentence on an individual being sentenced for an offense based upon a charge for a violation of Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, the individual must undergo a professional evaluation to determine if an alcohol or other drug abuse problem exists and the extent of such a problem. Programs conducting these evaluations shall be licensed by the Department of Human Services. However, if the individual is not a resident of Illinois, the court may, in its discretion, accept an evaluation from a program in the state of such individual’s residence. The court shall make a specific finding about whether the defendant is eligible for participation in a Department impact incarceration program as provided in Section 5-8-1.1 or 5-8-1.3, and if not, provide an explanation as to why a sentence to impact incarceration is not an appropriate sentence. The court may in its sentencing order recommend a defendant for placement in a Department of Corrections substance abuse treatment program as provided in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of Section 3-2-2 conditioned upon the defendant being accepted in a program by the Department of Corrections. At the hearing the court shall:\n\n\n(1) consider the evidence, if any, received upon the trial;\n\n\n(2) consider any presentence reports;\n\n\n(3) consider the financial impact of incarceration based on the financial impact statement filed with the clerk of the court by the Department of Corrections;\n\n\n(4) consider evidence and information offered by the parties in aggravation and mitigation;\n\n\n(4.5) consider substance abuse treatment, eligibility screening, and an assessment, if any, of the defendant by an agent designated by the State of Illinois to provide assessment services for the Illinois courts;\n\n\n(5) hear arguments as to sentencing alternatives;\n\n\n(6) afford the defendant the opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf;\n\n\n(7) afford the victim of a violent crime or a violation of Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, the opportunity to present an oral or written statement, as guaranteed by Article I, Section 8.1 of the Illinois Constitution and provided in Section 6 of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act. The court shall allow a victim to make an oral statement if the victim is present in the courtroom and requests to make an oral or written statement. An oral or written statement includes the victim or a representative of the victim reading the written statement. The court may allow persons impacted by the crime who are not victims under subsection (a) of Section 3 of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act to present an oral or written statement. A victim and any person making an oral statement shall not be put under oath or subject to cross-examination. All statements offered under this paragraph (7) shall become part of the record of the court. In this paragraph (7), “victim of a violent crime” means a person who is a victim of a violent crime for which the defendant has been convicted after a bench or jury trial or a person who is the victim of a violent crime with which the defendant was charged and the defendant has been convicted under a plea agreement of a crime that is not a violent crime as defined in subsection (c) of 3 of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act;\n\n\n(7.5) afford a qualified person affected by: (i) a violation of Section 405, 405.1, 405.2, or 407 of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act or a violation of Section 55 or Section 65 of the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act; or (ii) a Class 4 felony violation of Section 11-14, 11-14.3 except as described in subdivisions (a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(B), 11-15, 11-17, 11-18, 11-18.1, or 11-19 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, committed by the defendant the opportunity to make a statement concerning the impact on the qualified person and to offer evidence in aggravation or mitigation; provided that the statement and evidence offered in aggravation or mitigation shall first be prepared in writing in conjunction with the State’s Attorney before it may be presented orally at the hearing. Sworn testimony offered by the qualified person is subject to the defendant’s right to cross-examine. All statements and evidence offered under this paragraph (7.5) shall become part of the record of the court. In this paragraph (7.5), “qualified person” means any person who: (i) lived or worked within the territorial jurisdiction where the offense took place when the offense took place; or (ii) is familiar with various public places within the territorial jurisdiction where the offense took place when the offense took place. “Qualified person” includes any peace officer or any member of any duly organized State, county, or municipal peace officer unit assigned to the territorial jurisdiction where the offense took place when the offense took place;\n\n\n(8) in cases of reckless homicide afford the victim’s spouse, guardians, parents or other immediate family members an opportunity to make oral statements;\n\n\n(9) in cases involving a felony sex offense as defined under the Sex Offender Management Board Act, consider the results of the sex offender evaluation conducted pursuant to Section 5-3-2 of this Act; and\n\n\n(10) make a finding of whether a motor vehicle was used in the commission of the offense for which the defendant is being sentenced.\n\n\n(b) All sentences shall be imposed by the judge based upon his independent assessment of the elements specified above and any agreement as to sentence reached by the parties. The judge who presided at the trial or the judge who accepted the plea of guilty shall impose the sentence unless he is no longer sitting as a judge in that court. Where the judge does not impose sentence at the same time on all defendants who are convicted as a result of being involved in the same offense, the defendant or the State’s Attorney may advise the sentencing court of the disposition of any other defendants who have been sentenced.\n\n\n(b-1) In imposing a sentence of imprisonment or periodic imprisonment for a Class 3 or Class 4 felony for which a sentence of probation or conditional discharge is an available sentence, if the defendant has no prior sentence of probation or conditional discharge and no prior conviction for a violent crime, the defendant shall not be sentenced to imprisonment before review and consideration of a presentence report and determination and explanation of why the particular evidence, information, factor in aggravation, factual finding, or other reasons support a sentencing determination that one or more of the factors under subsection (a) of Section 5-6-1 of this Code apply and that probation or conditional discharge is not an appropriate sentence.\n\n\n(c) In imposing a sentence for a violent crime or for an offense of operating or being in physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, any other drug or any combination thereof, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, when such offense resulted in the personal injury to someone other than the defendant, the trial judge shall specify on the record the particular evidence, information, factors in mitigation and aggravation or other reasons that led to his sentencing determination. The full verbatim record of the sentencing hearing shall be filed with the clerk of the court and shall be a public record.\n\n\n(c-1) In imposing a sentence for the offense of aggravated kidnapping for ransom, home invasion, armed robbery, aggravated vehicular hijacking, aggravated discharge of a firearm, or armed violence with a category I weapon or category II weapon, the trial judge shall make a finding as to whether the conduct leading to conviction for the offense resulted in great bodily harm to a victim, and shall enter that finding and the basis for that finding in the record.\n\n\n(c-1.5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in imposing a sentence for an offense that requires a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment, the court may instead sentence the offender to probation, conditional discharge, or a lesser term of imprisonment it deems appropriate if: (1) the offense involves the use or possession of drugs, retail theft, or driving on a revoked license due to unpaid financial obligations; (2) the court finds that the defendant does not pose a risk to public safety; and (3) the interest of justice requires imposing a term of probation, conditional discharge, or a lesser term of imprisonment. The court must state on the record its reasons for imposing probation, conditional discharge, or a lesser term of imprisonment.\n\n\n(c-2) If the defendant is sentenced to prison, other than when a sentence of natural life imprisonment or a sentence of death is imposed, at the time the sentence is imposed the judge shall state on the record in open court the approximate period of time the defendant will serve in custody according to the then current statutory rules and regulations for sentence credit found in Section 3-6-3 and other related provisions of this Code. This statement is intended solely to inform the public, has no legal effect on the defendant’s actual release, and may not be relied on by the defendant on appeal.\n\n\nThe judge’s statement, to be given after pronouncing the sentence, other than when the sentence is imposed for one of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(4) of Section 3-6-3, shall include the following:\n\n\n“The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in prison as a result of this sentence. The actual period of prison time served is determined by the statutes of Illinois as applied to this sentence by the Illinois Department of Corrections and the Illinois Prisoner Review Board. In this case, assuming the defendant receives all of his or her sentence credit, the period of estimated actual custody is … years and … months, less up to 180 days additional earned sentence credit. If the defendant, because of his or her own misconduct or failure to comply with the institutional regulations, does not receive those credits, the actual time served in prison will be longer. The defendant may also receive an additional one-half day sentence credit for each day of participation in vocational, industry, substance abuse, and educational programs as provided for by Illinois statute.”\n\n\nWhen the sentence is imposed for one of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(2) of Section 3-6-3, other than first degree murder, and the offense was committed on or after June 19, 1998, and when the sentence is imposed for reckless homicide as defined in subsection (e) of Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 if the offense was committed on or after January 1, 1999, and when the sentence is imposed for aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination thereof as defined in subparagraph (F) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, and when the sentence is imposed for aggravated arson if the offense was committed on or after July 27, 2001 (the effective date of Public Act 92-176), and when the sentence is imposed for aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination thereof as defined in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code committed on or after January 1, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 96-1230), the judge’s statement, to be given after pronouncing the sentence, shall include the following:\n\n\n“The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in prison as a result of this sentence. The actual period of prison time served is determined by the statutes of Illinois as applied to this sentence by the Illinois Department of Corrections and the Illinois Prisoner Review Board. In this case, the defendant is entitled to no more than 4 1/2 days of sentence credit for each month of his or her sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, this defendant will serve at least 85% of his or her sentence. Assuming the defendant receives 4 1/2 days credit for each month of his or her sentence, the period of estimated actual custody is … years and … months. If the defendant, because of his or her own misconduct or failure to comply with the institutional regulations receives lesser credit, the actual time served in prison will be longer.” When a sentence of imprisonment is imposed for first degree murder and the offense was committed on or after June 19, 1998, the judge’s statement, to be given after pronouncing the sentence, shall include the following:\n\n\n“The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in prison as a result of this sentence. The actual period of prison time served is determined by the statutes of Illinois as applied to this sentence by the Illinois Department of Corrections and the Illinois Prisoner Review Board. In this case, the defendant is not entitled to sentence credit. Therefore, this defendant will serve 100% of his or her sentence.” When the sentencing order recommends placement in a substance abuse program for any offense that results in incarceration in a Department of Corrections facility and the crime was committed on or after September 1, 2003 (the effective date of Public Act 93-354), the judge’s statement, in addition to any other judge’s statement required under this Section, to be given after pronouncing the sentence, shall include the following:\n\n\n“The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in prison as a result of this sentence. The actual period of prison time served is determined by the statutes of Illinois as applied to this sentence by the Illinois Department of Corrections and the Illinois Prisoner Review Board. In this case, the defendant shall receive no earned sentence credit under clause (3) of subsection (a) of Section 3-6-3 until he or she participates in and completes a substance abuse treatment program or receives a waiver from the Director of Corrections pursuant to clause (4.5) of subsection (a) of Section 3-6-3.”\n\n\n(c-4) Before the sentencing hearing and as part of the presentence investigation under Section 5-3-1, the court shall inquire of the defendant whether the defendant is currently serving in or is a veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States. If the defendant is currently serving in the Armed Forces of the United States or is a veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States and has been diagnosed as having a mental illness by a qualified psychiatrist or clinical psychologist or physician, the court may:\n\n\n(1) order that the officer preparing the presentence report consult with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs, or another agency or person with suitable knowledge or experience for the purpose of providing the court with information regarding treatment options available to the defendant, including federal, State, and local programming; and\n\n\n(2) consider the treatment recommendations of any diagnosing or treating mental health professionals together with the treatment options available to the defendant in imposing sentence.\n\n\nFor the purposes of this subsection (c-4), “qualified psychiatrist” means a reputable physician licensed in Illinois to practice medicine in all its branches, who has specialized in the diagnosis and treatment of mental and nervous disorders for a period of not less than 5 years.\n\n\n(c-6) In imposing a sentence, the trial judge shall specify, on the record, the particular evidence and other reasons which led to his or her determination that a motor vehicle was used in the commission of the offense.\n\n\n(c-7) In imposing a sentence for a Class 3 or 4 felony, other than a violent crime as defined in Section 3 of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, the court shall determine and indicate in the sentencing order whether the defendant has 4 or more or fewer than 4 months remaining on his or her sentence accounting for time served.\n\n\n(d) When the defendant is committed to the Department of Corrections, the State’s Attorney shall and counsel for the defendant may file a statement with the clerk of the court to be transmitted to the department, agency or institution to which the defendant is committed to furnish such department, agency or institution with the facts and circumstances of the offense for which the person was committed together with all other factual information accessible to them in regard to the person prior to his commitment relative to his habits, associates, disposition and reputation and any other facts and circumstances which may aid such department, agency or institution during its custody of such person. The clerk shall within 10 days after receiving any such statements transmit a copy to such department, agency or institution and a copy to the other party, provided, however, that this shall not be cause for delay in conveying the person to the department, agency or institution to which he has been committed.\n\n\n(e) The clerk of the court shall transmit to the department, agency or institution, if any, to which the defendant is committed, the following:\n\n\n(1) the sentence imposed;\n\n\n(2) any statement by the court of the basis for imposing the sentence;\n\n\n(3) any presentence reports;\n\n\n(3.5) any sex offender evaluations;\n\n\n(3.6) any substance abuse treatment eligibility screening and assessment of the defendant by an agent designated by the State of Illinois to provide assessment services for the Illinois courts;\n\n\n(4) the number of days, if any, which the defendant has been in custody and for which he is entitled to credit against the sentence, which information shall be provided to the clerk by the sheriff;\n\n\n(4.1) any finding of great bodily harm made by the court with respect to an offense enumerated in subsection (c-1);\n\n\n(5) all statements filed under subsection (d) of this Section;\n\n\n(6) any medical or mental health records or summaries of the defendant;\n\n\n(7) the municipality where the arrest of the offender or the commission of the offense has occurred, where such municipality has a population of more than 25,000 persons;\n\n\n(8) all statements made and evidence offered under paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of this Section; and\n\n\n(9) all additional matters which the court directs the clerk to transmit.\n\n\n(f) In cases in which the court finds that a motor vehicle was used in the commission of the offense for which the defendant is being sentenced, the clerk of the court shall, within 5 days thereafter, forward a report of such conviction to the Secretary of State.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-81, eff. 7-12-19; 101-105, eff. 1-1-20; 101-652, Article 10, Section 10-281, eff. 7-1-21; 101-652, Article 20, Section 20-5, eff. 7-1-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22.)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-4-2) (from Ch. 38, par. 1005-4-2)"

The court, upon a plea of guilty or a stipulation by the defendant of the facts supporting the charge or a finding of guilt, may not defer further proceedings and the imposition of a sentence and may not enter an order for supervision of the defendant.\n\n\n(b) FELONY FINES. Unless otherwise specified by law, the minimum fine is $75. An offender may be sentenced to pay a fine not to exceed, for each offense, $25,000 or the amount specified in the offense, whichever is greater, or if the offender is a corporation, $50,000 or the amount specified in the offense, whichever is greater. A fine may be imposed in addition to a sentence of conditional discharge, probation, periodic imprisonment, or imprisonment. See Article 9 of Chapter V (730 ILCS 5/Ch. V, Art. 9) for imposition of additional amounts and determination of amounts and payment. If the court finds that the fine would impose an undue burden on the victim, the court may reduce or waive the fine.\n\n\n(c) REASONS FOR SENTENCE STATED. The sentencing judge in each felony conviction shall set forth his or her reasons for imposing the particular sentence entered in the case, as provided in Section 5-4-1 (730 ILCS 5/5-4-1). Those reasons may include any mitigating or aggravating factors specified in this Code, or the lack of any such factors, as well as any other mitigating or aggravating factors that the judge sets forth on the record that are consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing set out in this Code.\n\n\n(d) MOTION TO REDUCE SENTENCE. A motion to reduce a sentence may be made, or the court may reduce a sentence without motion, within 30 days after the sentence is imposed. A defendant’s challenge to the correctness of a sentence or to any aspect of the sentencing hearing shall be made by a written motion filed with the circuit court clerk within 30 days following the imposition of sentence. A motion not filed within that 30-day period is not timely. The court may not increase a sentence once it is imposed. A notice of motion must be filed with the motion. The notice of motion shall set the motion on the court’s calendar on a date certain within a reasonable time after the date of filing.\n\n\nIf a motion filed pursuant to this subsection is timely filed, the proponent of the motion shall exercise due diligence in seeking a determination on the motion and the court shall thereafter decide the motion within a reasonable time.\n\n\nIf a motion filed pursuant to this subsection is timely filed, then for purposes of perfecting an appeal, a final judgment is not considered to have been entered until the motion to reduce the sentence has been decided by order entered by the trial court.\n\n\n(e) CONCURRENT SENTENCE; PREVIOUS UNEXPIRED FEDERAL OR OTHER-STATE SENTENCE. A defendant who has a previous and unexpired sentence of imprisonment imposed by another state or by any district court of the United States and who, after sentence for a crime in Illinois, must return to serve the unexpired prior sentence may have his or her sentence by the Illinois court ordered to be concurrent with the prior other-state or federal sentence. The court may order that any time served on the unexpired portion of the other-state or federal sentence, prior to his or her return to Illinois, shall be credited on his or her Illinois sentence. The appropriate official of the other state or the United States shall be furnished with a copy of the order imposing sentence, which shall provide that, when the offender is released from other-state or federal confinement, whether by parole or by termination of sentence, the offender shall be transferred by the Sheriff of the committing Illinois county to the Illinois Department of Corrections. The court shall cause the Department of Corrections to be notified of the sentence at the time of commitment and to be provided with copies of all records regarding the sentence.\n\n\n(f) REDUCTION; PREVIOUS UNEXPIRED ILLINOIS SENTENCE. A defendant who has a previous and unexpired sentence of imprisonment imposed by an Illinois circuit court for a crime in this State and who is subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment by another state or by any district court of the United States and who has served a term of imprisonment imposed by the other state or district court of the United States, and must return to serve the unexpired prior sentence imposed by the Illinois circuit court, may apply to the Illinois circuit court that imposed sentence to have his or her sentence reduced.\n\n\nThe circuit court may order that any time served on the sentence imposed by the other state or district court of the United States be credited on his or her Illinois sentence. The application for reduction of a sentence under this subsection shall be made within 30 days after the defendant has completed the sentence imposed by the other state or district court of the United States.\n\n\n(g) NO REQUIRED BIRTH CONTROL. A court may not impose a sentence or disposition that requires the defendant to be implanted or injected with or to use any form of birth control.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 100-987, eff. 7-1-19; 100-1161, eff. 7-1-19 .)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-55)"

After a plea or verdict or finding of guilty and before sentence is imposed, the prosecutor may file with the court a verified written statement signed by the State’s Attorney concerning any former conviction of an offense set forth in this Section rendered against the defendant.

If a sentence has previously been imposed, the court may vacate that sentence and impose a new sentence in accordance with this Section.\n\n\n(7) A duly authenticated copy of the record of any alleged former conviction of an offense set forth in this Section shall be prima facie evidence of that former conviction; and a duly authenticated copy of the record of the defendant’s final release or discharge from probation granted, or from sentence and parole supervision (if any) imposed pursuant to that former conviction, shall be prima facie evidence of that release or discharge.\n\n\n(8) Any claim that a previous conviction offered by the prosecution is not a former conviction of an offense set forth in this Section because of the existence of any exceptions described in this Section, is waived unless duly raised at the hearing on that conviction, or unless the prosecution’s proof shows the existence of the exceptions described in this Section.\n\n\n(9) If the person so convicted shows to the satisfaction of the court before whom that conviction was had that he or she was released from imprisonment, upon either of the sentences upon a pardon granted for the reason that he or she was innocent, that conviction and sentence shall not be considered under this Section.\n\n\n(b) When a defendant, over the age of 21 years, is convicted of a Class 1 or Class 2 forcible felony after having twice been convicted in any state or federal court of an offense that contains the same elements as an offense now (the date the Class 1 or Class 2 forcible felony was committed) classified in Illinois as a Class 2 or greater Class forcible felony and those charges are separately brought and tried and arise out of different series of acts, that defendant shall be sentenced as a Class X offender.

The petition shall include a copy of the order of commitment and sentence to the Department of Corrections for the offense or offenses for which review is sought. Within 30 days of receipt of this petition, the Prisoner Review Board shall determine whether the petition is appropriately filed, and if so, shall set a date for parole review 3 years from receipt of the petition and notify the Department of Corrections within 10 business days. If the Prisoner Review Board determines that the petition is not appropriately filed, it shall notify the petitioner in writing, including a basis for its determination.\n\n\n(d) Within 6 months of the Prisoner Review Board’s determination that the petition was appropriately filed, a representative from the Department of Corrections shall meet with the eligible person and provide the inmate information about the parole hearing process and personalized recommendations for the inmate regarding his or her work assignments, rehabilitative programs, and institutional behavior. Following this meeting, the eligible person has 7 calendar days to file a written request to the representative from the Department of Corrections who met with the eligible person of any additional programs and services which the eligible person believes should be made available to prepare the eligible person for return to the community.\n\n\n(e) One year prior to the person being eligible for parole, counsel shall be appointed by the Prisoner Review Board upon a finding of indigency.

Victim statements shall not be considered public documents under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. The inmate or his or her attorney shall not be given a copy of the statement, but shall be informed of the existence of a victim statement and the position taken by the victim on the inmate’s request for parole. This shall not be construed to permit disclosure to an inmate of any information which might result in the risk of threats or physical harm to a victim. The Prisoner Review Board shall have an ongoing duty to provide the eligible person, and his or her counsel, with any further documents or materials that come into its possession prior to the hearing subject to the limitations contained in this subsection.\n\n\n(g) Not less than 12 months prior to the hearing, the Prisoner Review Board shall provide notification to the State’s Attorney of the county from which the person was committed and written notification to the victim or family of the victim of the scheduled hearing place, date, and approximate time. The written notification shall contain: (1) information about their right to be present, appear in person at the parole hearing, and their right to make an oral statement and submit information in writing, by videotape, tape recording, or other electronic means; (2) a toll-free number to call for further information about the parole review process; and (3) information regarding available resources, including trauma-informed therapy, they may access. If the Board does not have knowledge of the current address of the victim or family of the victim, it shall notify the State’s Attorney of the county of commitment and request assistance in locating the victim or family of the victim. Those victims or family of the victims who advise the Board in writing that they no longer wish to be notified shall not receive future notices. A victim shall have the right to submit information by videotape, tape recording, or other electronic means. The victim may submit this material prior to or at the parole hearing. The victim also has the right to be heard at the parole hearing.\n\n\n(h) The hearing conducted by the Prisoner Review Board shall be governed by Sections 15 and 20, subsection (f) of Section 5, subsections (a), (a-5), (b), (b-5), and (c) of Section 10, and subsection (d) of Section 25 of the Open Parole Hearings Act and Part 1610 of Title 20 of the Illinois Administrative Code. The eligible person has a right to be present at the Prisoner Review Board hearing, unless the Prisoner Review Board determines the eligible person’s presence is unduly burdensome when conducting a hearing under paragraph (6.6) of subsection (a) of Section 3-3-2 of this Code. If a psychological evaluation is submitted for the Prisoner Review Board’s consideration, it shall be prepared by a person who has expertise in adolescent brain development and behavior, and shall take into consideration the diminished culpability of youthful offenders, the hallmark features of youth, and any subsequent growth and increased maturity of the person. At the hearing, the eligible person shall have the right to make a statement on his or her own behalf.\n\n\n(i) Only upon motion for good cause shall the date for the Prisoner Review Board hearing, as set by subsection (b) of this Section, be changed. No less than 15 days prior to the hearing, the Prisoner Review Board shall notify the victim or victim representative, the attorney, and the eligible person of the exact date and time of the hearing. All hearings shall be open to the public.\n\n\n(j) The Prisoner Review Board shall not parole the eligible person if it determines that:\n\n\n(1) there is a substantial risk that the eligible person will not conform to reasonable conditions of parole or aftercare release; or\n\n\n(2) the eligible person’s release at that time would deprecate the seriousness of his or her offense or promote disrespect for the law; or\n\n\n(3) the eligible person’s release would have a substantially adverse effect on institutional discipline.\n\n\nIn considering the factors affecting the release determination under 20 Ill. Adm. Code 1610.50(b), the Prisoner Review Board panel shall consider the diminished culpability of youthful offenders, the hallmark features of youth, and any subsequent growth and maturity of the youthful offender during incarceration.\n\n\n(k) Unless denied parole under subsection (j) of this Section and subject to the provisions of Section 3-3-9 of this Code: (1) the eligible person serving a sentence for any non-first degree murder offense or offenses, shall be released on parole which shall operate to discharge any remaining term of years sentence imposed upon him or her, notwithstanding any required mandatory supervised release period the eligible person is required to serve; and (2) the eligible person serving a sentence for any first degree murder offense, shall be released on mandatory supervised release for a period of 10 years subject to Section 3-3-8, which shall operate to discharge any remaining term of years sentence imposed upon him or her, however in no event shall the eligible person serve a period of mandatory supervised release greater than the aggregate of the discharged underlying sentence and the mandatory supervised release period as sent forth in Section 5-4.5-20.\n\n\n(l) If the Prisoner Review Board denies parole after conducting the hearing under subsection (j) of this Section, it shall issue a written decision which states the rationale for denial, including the primary factors considered. This decision shall be provided to the eligible person and his or her counsel within 30 days.\n\n\n(m) A person denied parole under subsection (j) of this Section, who is not serving a sentence for either first degree murder or aggravated criminal sexual assault, shall be eligible for a second parole review by the Prisoner Review Board 5 years after the written decision under subsection (l) of this Section; a person denied parole under subsection (j) of this Section, who is serving a sentence or sentences for first degree murder or aggravated criminal sexual assault shall be eligible for a second and final parole review by the Prisoner Review Board 10 years after the written decision under subsection (k) of this Section. The procedures for a second parole review shall be governed by subsections (c) through (k) of this Section.\n\n\n(n) A person denied parole under subsection (m) of this Section, who is not serving a sentence for either first degree murder or aggravated criminal sexual assault, shall be eligible for a third and final parole review by the Prisoner Review Board 5 years after the written decision under subsection (l) of this Section. The procedures for the third and final parole review shall be governed by subsections (c) through (k) of this Section.\n\n\n(o) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Section, nothing in this Section shall be construed to delay parole or mandatory supervised release consideration for petitioners who are or will be eligible for release earlier than this Section provides. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as a limit, substitution, or bar on a person’s right to sentencing relief, or any other manner of relief, obtained by order of a court in proceedings other than as provided in this Section.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 100-1182, eff. 6-1-19; 101-288, eff. 1-1-20 .)\n\n\n(Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 102-1128 )"

Parole review of persons under the age of 21 at the time of the commission of an offense.\n\n(a) For purposes of this Section, “victim” means a victim of a violent crime as defined in subsection (a) of Section 3 of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act including a witness as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3 of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act; any person legally related to the victim by blood, marriage, adoption, or guardianship; any friend of the victim; or any concerned citizen.\n\n\n(b) A person under 21 years of age at the time of the commission of an offense or offenses, other than first degree murder, and who is not serving a sentence for first degree murder and who is sentenced on or after June 1, 2019 (the effective date of Public Act 100-1182) shall be eligible for parole review by the Prisoner Review Board after serving 10 years or more of his or her sentence or sentences, except for those serving a sentence or sentences for: (1) aggravated criminal sexual assault who shall be eligible for parole review by the Prisoner Review Board after serving 20 years or more of his or her sentence or sentences or (2) predatory criminal sexual assault of a child who shall not be eligible for parole review by the Prisoner Review Board under this Section. A person under 21 years of age at the time of the commission of first degree murder who is sentenced on or after June 1, 2019 (the effective date of Public Act 100-1182) shall be eligible for parole review by the Prisoner Review Board after serving 20 years or more of his or her sentence or sentences, except for those subject to a term of natural life imprisonment under Section 5-8-1 of this Code or any person subject to sentencing under subsection (c) of Section 5-4.5-105 of this Code, who shall be eligible for parole review by the Prisoner Review Board after serving 40 years or more of his or her sentence or sentences.\n\n\n(c) Three years prior to becoming eligible for parole review, the eligible person may file his or her petition for parole review with the Prisoner Review Board. The petition shall include a copy of the order of commitment and sentence to the Department of Corrections for the offense or offenses for which review is sought. Within 30 days of receipt of this petition, the Prisoner Review Board shall determine whether the petition is appropriately filed, and if so, shall set a date for parole review 3 years from receipt of the petition and notify the Department of Corrections within 10 business days. If the Prisoner Review Board determines that the petition is not appropriately filed, it shall notify the petitioner in writing, including a basis for its determination.\n\n\n(d) Within 6 months of the Prisoner Review Board’s determination that the petition was appropriately filed, a representative from the Department of Corrections shall meet with the eligible person and provide the inmate information about the parole hearing process and personalized recommendations for the inmate regarding his or her work assignments, rehabilitative programs, and institutional behavior. Following this meeting, the eligible person has 7 calendar days to file a written request to the representative from the Department of Corrections who met with the eligible person of any additional programs and services which the eligible person believes should be made available to prepare the eligible person for return to the community.\n\n\n(e) One year prior to the person being eligible for parole, counsel shall be appointed by the Prisoner Review Board upon a finding of indigency. The eligible person may waive appointed counsel or retain his or her own counsel at his or her own expense.\n\n\n(f) Nine months prior to the hearing, the Prisoner Review Board shall provide the eligible person, and his or her counsel, any written documents or materials it will be considering in making its decision unless the written documents or materials are specifically found to: (1) include information which, if disclosed, would damage the therapeutic relationship between the inmate and a mental health professional; (2) subject any person to the actual risk of physical harm; (3) threaten the safety or security of the Department or an institution. In accordance with Section 4.5(d)(4) of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act and Section 10 of the Open Parole Hearings Act, victim statements provided to the Board shall be confidential and privileged, including any statements received prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly, except if the statement was an oral statement made by the victim at a hearing open to the public. Victim statements shall not be considered public documents under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. The inmate or his or her attorney shall not be given a copy of the statement, but shall be informed of the existence of a victim statement and the position taken by the victim on the inmate’s request for parole. This shall not be construed to permit disclosure to an inmate of any information which might result in the risk of threats or physical harm to a victim. The Prisoner Review Board shall have an ongoing duty to provide the eligible person, and his or her counsel, with any further documents or materials that come into its possession prior to the hearing subject to the limitations contained in this subsection.\n\n\n(g) Not less than 12 months prior to the hearing, the Prisoner Review Board shall provide notification to the State’s Attorney of the county from which the person was committed and written notification to the victim or family of the victim of the scheduled hearing place, date, and approximate time. The written notification shall contain: (1) information about their right to be present, appear in person at the parole hearing, and their right to make an oral statement and submit information in writing, by videotape, tape recording, or other electronic means; (2) a toll-free number to call for further information about the parole review process; and (3) information regarding available resources, including trauma-informed therapy, they may access. If the Board does not have knowledge of the current address of the victim or family of the victim, it shall notify the State’s Attorney of the county of commitment and request assistance in locating the victim or family of the victim. Those victims or family of the victims who advise the Board in writing that they no longer wish to be notified shall not receive future notices. A victim shall have the right to submit information by videotape, tape recording, or other electronic means. The victim may submit this material prior to or at the parole hearing. The victim also has the right to be heard at the parole hearing.\n\n\n(h) The hearing conducted by the Prisoner Review Board shall be governed by Sections 15 and 20, subsection (f) of Section 5, subsections (a), (a-5), (b), (b-5), and (c) of Section 10, and subsection (d) of Section 25 of the Open Parole Hearings Act and Part 1610 of Title 20 of the Illinois Administrative Code. The eligible person has a right to be present at the Prisoner Review Board hearing, unless the Prisoner Review Board determines the eligible person’s presence is unduly burdensome when conducting a hearing under paragraph (6.6) of subsection (a) of Section 3-3-2 of this Code. If a psychological evaluation is submitted for the Prisoner Review Board’s consideration, it shall be prepared by a person who has expertise in adolescent brain development and behavior, and shall take into consideration the diminished culpability of youthful offenders, the hallmark features of youth, and any subsequent growth and increased maturity of the person. At the hearing, the eligible person shall have the right to make a statement on his or her own behalf.\n\n\n(i) Only upon motion for good cause shall the date for the Prisoner Review Board hearing, as set by subsection (b) of this Section, be changed. No less than 15 days prior to the hearing, the Prisoner Review Board shall notify the victim or victim representative, the attorney, and the eligible person of the exact date and time of the hearing. All hearings shall be open to the public.\n\n\n(j) The Prisoner Review Board shall not parole the eligible person if it determines that:\n\n\n(1) there is a substantial risk that the eligible person will not conform to reasonable conditions of parole or aftercare release; or\n\n\n(2) the eligible person’s release at that time would deprecate the seriousness of his or her offense or promote disrespect for the law; or\n\n\n(3) the eligible person’s release would have a substantially adverse effect on institutional discipline.\n\n\nIn considering the factors affecting the release determination under 20 Ill. Adm. Code 1610.50(b), the Prisoner Review Board panel shall consider the diminished culpability of youthful offenders, the hallmark features of youth, and any subsequent growth and maturity of the youthful offender during incarceration.\n\n\n(k) Unless denied parole under subsection (j) of this Section and subject to the provisions of Section 3-3-9 of this Code: (1) the eligible person serving a sentence for any non-first degree murder offense or offenses, shall be released on parole which shall operate to discharge any remaining term of years sentence imposed upon him or her, notwithstanding any required mandatory supervised release period the eligible person is required to serve; and (2) the eligible person serving a sentence for any first degree murder offense, shall be released on mandatory supervised release for a period of 10 years subject to Section 3-3-8, which shall operate to discharge any remaining term of years sentence imposed upon him or her, however in no event shall the eligible person serve a period of mandatory supervised release greater than the aggregate of the discharged underlying sentence and the mandatory supervised release period as sent forth in Section 5-4.5-20.\n\n\n(l) If the Prisoner Review Board denies parole after conducting the hearing under subsection (j) of this Section, it shall issue a written decision which states the rationale for denial, including the primary factors considered. This decision shall be provided to the eligible person and his or her counsel within 30 days.\n\n\n(m) A person denied parole under subsection (j) of this Section, who is not serving a sentence for either first degree murder or aggravated criminal sexual assault, shall be eligible for a second parole review by the Prisoner Review Board 5 years after the written decision under subsection (l) of this Section; a person denied parole under subsection (j) of this Section, who is serving a sentence or sentences for first degree murder or aggravated criminal sexual assault shall be eligible for a second and final parole review by the Prisoner Review Board 10 years after the written decision under subsection (k) of this Section. The procedures for a second parole review shall be governed by subsections (c) through (k) of this Section.\n\n\n(n) A person denied parole under subsection (m) of this Section, who is not serving a sentence for either first degree murder or aggravated criminal sexual assault, shall be eligible for a third and final parole review by the Prisoner Review Board 5 years after the written decision under subsection (l) of this Section. The procedures for the third and final parole review shall be governed by subsections (c) through (k) of this Section.\n\n\n(o) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Section, nothing in this Section shall be construed to delay parole or mandatory supervised release consideration for petitioners who are or will be eligible for release earlier than this Section provides. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as a limit, substitution, or bar on a person’s right to sentencing relief, or any other manner of relief, obtained by order of a court in proceedings other than as provided in this Section.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-288, eff. 1-1-20; 102-1128, eff. 1-1-24.)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-990)"

    "text": "Sec. 5-5-3.1. Factors in mitigation.\n\n(a) The following grounds shall be accorded weight in favor of withholding or minimizing a sentence of imprisonment:\n\n\n(1) The defendant’s criminal conduct neither caused nor threatened serious physical harm to another.\n\n\n(2) The defendant did not contemplate that his criminal conduct would cause or threaten serious physical harm to another.\n\n\n(3) The defendant acted under a strong provocation.\n\n\n(4) There were substantial grounds tending to excuse or justify the defendant’s criminal conduct, though failing to establish a defense.\n\n\n(5) The defendant’s criminal conduct was induced or facilitated by someone other than the defendant.\n\n\n(6) The defendant has compensated or will compensate the victim of his criminal conduct for the damage or injury that he sustained.\n\n\n(7) The defendant has no history of prior delinquency or criminal activity or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present crime.\n\n\n(8) The defendant’s criminal conduct was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur.\n\n\n(9) The character and attitudes of the defendant indicate that he is unlikely to commit another crime.\n\n\n(10) The defendant is particularly likely to comply with the terms of a period of probation.\n\n\n(11) (Blank).\n\n\n(12) The imprisonment of the defendant would endanger his or her medical condition.\n\n\n(13) The defendant was a person with an intellectual disability as defined in Section 5-1-13 of this Code.\n\n\n(14) The defendant sought or obtained emergency medical assistance for an overdose and was convicted of a Class 3 felony or higher possession, manufacture, or delivery of a controlled, counterfeit, or look-alike substance or a controlled substance analog under the Illinois Controlled Substances Act or a Class 2 felony or higher possession, manufacture or delivery of methamphetamine under the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act.\n\n\n(15) At the time of the offense, the defendant is or had been the victim of domestic violence and the effects of the domestic violence tended to excuse or justify the defendant’s criminal conduct. As used in this paragraph (15), “domestic violence” means abuse as defined in Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986.\n\n\n(16) At the time of the offense, the defendant was suffering from a serious mental illness which, though insufficient to establish the defense of insanity, substantially affected his or her ability to understand the nature of his or her acts or to conform his or her conduct to the requirements of the law.\n\n\n(17) At the time of the offense, the defendant was suffering from post-partum depression or post-partum psychosis which was either undiagnosed or untreated, or both, and this temporary mental illness tended to excuse or justify the defendant’s criminal conduct and the defendant has been diagnosed as suffering from post-partum depression or post-partum psychosis, or both, by a qualified medical person and the diagnoses or testimony, or both, was not used at trial. In this paragraph (17):\n\n\n“Post-partum depression” means a mood disorder which strikes many women during and after pregnancy which usually occurs during pregnancy and up to 12 months after delivery. This depression can include anxiety disorders.\n\n\n“Post-partum psychosis” means an extreme form of post-partum depression which can occur during pregnancy and up to 12 months after delivery.

Circumstances to be considered in assessing this factor in mitigation include:\n\n\n(A) that the parent is breastfeeding the child;\n\n\n(B) the age of the child, with strong consideration given to avoid disruption of the caregiving of an infant, pre-school or school-age child by a parent;\n\n\n(C) the role of the parent in the day-to-day educational and medical needs of the child;\n\n\n(D) the relationship of the parent and the child;\n\n\n(E) any special medical, educational, or psychological needs of the child;\n\n\n(F) the role of the parent in the financial support of the child;\n\n\n(G) the likelihood that the child will be adjudged a dependent minor under Section 2-4 and declared a ward of the court under Section 2-22 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987;\n\n\n(H) the best interest of the child.\n\n\nUnder this Section, the defendant shall have the right to present a Family Impact Statement at sentencing, which the court shall consider in favor of withholding or minimizing a sentence of imprisonment prior to imposing any sentence and may include testimony from family and community members, written statements, video, and documentation. Unless the court finds that the parent poses a significant risk to the community that outweighs the risk of harm from the parent’s removal from the family, the court shall impose a sentence in accordance with subsection (b) that allows the parent to continue to care for the child or children.\n\n\n(19) The defendant serves as the caregiver for a relative who is ill, disabled, or elderly.\n\n\n(b) If the court, having due regard for the character of the offender, the nature and circumstances of the offense and the public interest finds that a sentence of imprisonment is the most appropriate disposition of the offender, or where other provisions of this Code mandate the imprisonment of the offender, the grounds listed in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be considered as factors in mitigation of the term imposed.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-471, eff. 1-1-20; 102-211, eff. 1-1-22 .)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-5-3.2)\n\n(Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-982 )"

    "text": "Sec. 5-5-6.\n\nIn all convictions for offenses in violation of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or of Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code in which the person received any injury to his or her person or damage to his or her real or personal property as a result of the criminal act of the defendant, the court shall order restitution as provided in this Section. In all other cases, except cases in which restitution is required under this Section, the court must at the sentence hearing determine whether restitution is an appropriate sentence to be imposed on each defendant convicted of an offense. If the court determines that an order directing the offender to make restitution is appropriate, the offender may be sentenced to make restitution. The court may consider restitution an appropriate sentence to be imposed on each defendant convicted of an offense in addition to a sentence of imprisonment. The sentence of the defendant to a term of imprisonment is not a mitigating factor that prevents the court from ordering the defendant to pay restitution. If the offender is sentenced to make restitution the Court shall determine the restitution as hereinafter set forth:\n\n\n(a) At the sentence hearing, the court shall determine whether the property may be restored in kind to the possession of the owner or the person entitled to possession thereof; or whether the defendant is possessed of sufficient skill to repair and restore property damaged; or whether the defendant should be required to make restitution in cash, for out-of-pocket expenses, damages, losses, or injuries found to have been proximately caused by the conduct of the defendant or another for whom the defendant is legally accountable under the provisions of Article 5 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012.\n\n\n(b) In fixing the amount of restitution to be paid in cash, the court shall allow credit for property returned in kind, for property damages ordered to be repaired by the defendant, and for property ordered to be restored by the defendant; and after granting the credit, the court shall assess the actual out-of-pocket expenses, losses, damages, and injuries suffered by the victim named in the charge and any other victims who may also have suffered out-of-pocket expenses, losses, damages, and injuries proximately caused by the same criminal conduct of the defendant, and insurance carriers who have indemnified the named victim or other victims for the out-of-pocket expenses, losses, damages, or injuries, provided that in no event shall restitution be ordered to be paid on account of pain and suffering. When a victim’s out-of-pocket expenses have been paid pursuant to the Crime Victims Compensation Act, the court shall order restitution be paid to the compensation program. If a defendant is placed on supervision for, or convicted of, domestic battery, the defendant shall be required to pay restitution to any domestic violence shelter in which the victim and any other family or household members lived because of the domestic battery. The amount of the restitution shall equal the actual expenses of the domestic violence shelter in providing housing and any other services for the victim and any other family or household members living at the shelter. If a defendant fails to pay restitution in the manner or within the time period specified by the court, the court may enter an order directing the sheriff to seize any real or personal property of a defendant to the extent necessary to satisfy the order of restitution and dispose of the property by public sale. All proceeds from such sale in excess of the amount of restitution plus court costs and the costs of the sheriff in conducting the sale shall be paid to the defendant. The defendant convicted of domestic battery, if a person under 18 years of age was present and witnessed the domestic battery of the victim, is liable to pay restitution for the cost of any counseling required for the child at the discretion of the court.\n\n\n(c) In cases where more than one defendant is accountable for the same criminal conduct that results in out-of-pocket expenses, losses, damages, or injuries, each defendant shall be ordered to pay restitution in the amount of the total actual out-of-pocket expenses, losses, damages, or injuries to the victim proximately caused by the conduct of all of the defendants who are legally accountable for the offense.\n\n\n(1) In no event shall the victim be entitled to recover restitution in excess of the actual out-of-pocket expenses, losses, damages, or injuries, proximately caused by the conduct of all of the defendants.\n\n\n(2) As between the defendants, the court may apportion the restitution that is payable in proportion to each co-defendant’s culpability in the commission of the offense.\n\n\n(3) In the absence of a specific order apportioning the restitution, each defendant shall bear his pro rata share of the restitution.\n\n\n(4) As between the defendants, each defendant shall be entitled to a pro rata reduction in the total restitution required to be paid to the victim for amounts of restitution actually paid by co-defendants, and defendants who shall have paid more than their pro rata share shall be entitled to refunds to be computed by the court as additional amounts are paid by co-defendants.\n\n\n(d) In instances where a defendant has more than one criminal charge pending against him in a single case, or more than one case, and the defendant stands convicted of one or more charges, a plea agreement negotiated by the State’s Attorney and the defendants may require the defendant to make restitution to victims of charges that have been dismissed or which it is contemplated will be dismissed under the terms of the plea agreement, and under the agreement, the court may impose a sentence of restitution on the charge or charges of which the defendant has been convicted that would require the defendant to make restitution to victims of other offenses as provided in the plea agreement.\n\n\n(e) The court may require the defendant to apply the balance of the cash bond, after payment of court costs, and any fine that may be imposed to the payment of restitution.\n\n\n(f) Taking into consideration the ability of the defendant to pay, including any real or personal property or any other assets of the defendant, the court shall determine whether restitution shall be paid in a single payment or in installments, and shall fix a period of time not in excess of 5 years, except for violations of Sections 16-1.3 and 17-56 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, or the period of time specified in subsection (f-1), not including periods of incarceration, within which payment of restitution is to be paid in full. Complete restitution shall be paid in as short a time period as possible. However, if the court deems it necessary and in the best interest of the victim, the court may extend beyond 5 years the period of time within which the payment of restitution is to be paid. If the defendant is ordered to pay restitution and the court orders that restitution is to be paid over a period greater than 6 months, the court shall order that the defendant make monthly payments; the court may waive this requirement of monthly payments only if there is a specific finding of good cause for waiver.\n\n\n(f-1)(1) In addition to any other penalty prescribed by law and any restitution ordered under this Section that did not include long-term physical health care costs, the court may, upon conviction of any misdemeanor or felony, order a defendant to pay restitution to a victim in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (f-1) if the victim has suffered physical injury as a result of the offense that is reasonably probable to require or has required long-term physical health care for more than 3 months. As used in this subsection (f-1), “long-term physical health care” includes mental health care.\n\n\n(2) The victim’s estimate of long-term physical health care costs may be made as part of a victim impact statement under Section 6 of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act or made separately. The court shall enter the long-term physical health care restitution order at the time of sentencing. An order of restitution made under this subsection (f-1) shall fix a monthly amount to be paid by the defendant for as long as long-term physical health care of the victim is required as a result of the offense. The order may exceed the length of any sentence imposed upon the defendant for the criminal activity. The court shall include as a special finding in the judgment of conviction its determination of the monthly cost of long-term physical health care.\n\n\n(3) After a sentencing order has been entered, the court may from time to time, on the petition of either the defendant or the victim, or upon its own motion, enter an order for restitution for long-term physical care or modify the existing order for restitution for long-term physical care as to the amount of monthly payments. Any modification of the order shall be based only upon a substantial change of circumstances relating to the cost of long-term physical health care or the financial condition of either the defendant or the victim. The petition shall be filed as part of the original criminal docket.\n\n\n(g) In addition to the sentences provided for in Sections 11-1.20, 11-1.30, 11-1.40, 11-1.50, 11-1.60, 11-19.2, 11-20.1, 11-20.1B, 11-20.3, 12-13, 12-14, 12-14.1, 12-15, and 12-16, and subdivision (a)(4) of Section 11-14.4, of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, the court may order any person who is convicted of violating any of those Sections or who was charged with any of those offenses and which charge was reduced to another charge as a result of a plea agreement under subsection (d) of this Section to meet all or any portion of the financial obligations of treatment, including but not limited to medical, psychiatric, or rehabilitative treatment or psychological counseling, prescribed for the victim or victims of the offense.\n\n\nThe payments shall be made by the defendant to the clerk of the circuit court and transmitted by the clerk to the appropriate person or agency as directed by the court. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f-1), the order may require such payments to be made for a period not to exceed 5 years after sentencing, not including periods of incarceration.\n\n\n(h) The judge may enter an order of withholding to collect the amount of restitution owed in accordance with Part 8 of Article XII of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n(i) A sentence of restitution may be modified or revoked by the court if the offender commits another offense, or the offender fails to make restitution as ordered by the court, but no sentence to make restitution shall be revoked unless the court shall find that the offender has had the financial ability to make restitution, and he has wilfully refused to do so. When the offender’s ability to pay restitution was established at the time an order of restitution was entered or modified, or when the offender’s ability to pay was based on the offender’s willingness to make restitution as part of a plea agreement made at the time the order of restitution was entered or modified, there is a rebuttable presumption that the facts and circumstances considered by the court at the hearing at which the order of restitution was entered or modified regarding the offender’s ability or willingness to pay restitution have not materially changed. If the court shall find that the defendant has failed to make restitution and that the failure is not wilful, the court may impose an additional period of time within which to make restitution. The length of the additional period shall not be more than 2 years. The court shall retain all of the incidents of the original sentence, including the authority to modify or enlarge the conditions, and to revoke or further modify the sentence if the conditions of payment are violated during the additional period.\n\n\n(j) The procedure upon the filing of a Petition to Revoke a sentence to make restitution shall be the same as the procedures set forth in Section 5-6-4 of this Code governing violation, modification, or revocation of Probation, of Conditional Discharge, or of Supervision.\n\n\n(k) Nothing contained in this Section shall preclude the right of any party to proceed in a civil action to recover for any damages incurred due to the criminal misconduct of the defendant.\n\n\n(l) Restitution ordered under this Section shall not be subject to disbursement by the circuit clerk under the Criminal and Traffic Assessment Act.\n\n\n(m) A restitution order under this Section is a judgment lien in favor of the victim that:\n\n\n(1) Attaches to the property of the person subject to the order;\n\n\n(2) May be perfected in the same manner as provided in Part 3 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code;\n\n\n(3) May be enforced to satisfy any payment that is delinquent under the restitution order by the person in whose favor the order is issued or the person’s assignee; and\n\n\n(4) Expires in the same manner as a judgment lien created in a civil proceeding.\n\n\nWhen a restitution order is issued under this Section, the issuing court shall send a certified copy of the order to the clerk of the circuit court in the county where the charge was filed. Upon receiving the order, the clerk shall enter and index the order in the circuit court judgment docket.\n\n\n(n) An order of restitution under this Section does not bar a civil action for:\n\n\n(1) Damages that the court did not require the person to pay to the victim under the restitution order but arise from an injury or property damages that is the basis of restitution ordered by the court; and\n\n\n(2) Other damages suffered by the victim.\n\n\nThe restitution order is not discharged by the completion of the sentence imposed for the offense.\n\n\nA restitution order under this Section is not discharged by the liquidation of a person’s estate by a receiver. A restitution order under this Section may be enforced in the same manner as judgment liens are enforced under Article XII of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n\nThe provisions of Section 2-1303 of the Code of Civil Procedure, providing for interest on judgments, apply to judgments for restitution entered under this Section.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 100-987, eff. 7-1-19; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19.)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-5-7) (from Ch. 38, par. 1005-5-7)\n## Sec. 5-5-7.\n\nNeither the State, any local government, probation department, public or community service program or site, nor any official, volunteer, or employee thereof acting in the course of their official duties shall be liable for any injury or loss a person might receive while performing public or community service as ordered either (1) by the court or (2) by any duly authorized station or probation adjustment, teen court, community mediation, or other administrative diversion program authorized by the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 for a violation of a penal statute of this State or a local government ordinance (whether penal, civil, or quasi-criminal) or for a traffic offense, nor shall they be liable for any tortious acts of any person performing public or community service, except for wilful, wanton misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such governmental unit, probation department, or public or community service program or site, or the official, volunteer, or employee.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 91-820, eff. 6-13-00.)\n\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-5-8) (from Ch. 38, par. 1005-5-8)"

    "text": "Sec. 5-6-1. Sentences of probation and of conditional discharge and disposition of supervision.\n\nThe General Assembly finds that in order to protect the public, the criminal justice system must compel compliance with the conditions of probation by responding to violations with swift, certain and fair punishments and intermediate sanctions. The Chief Judge of each circuit shall adopt a system of structured, intermediate sanctions for violations of the terms and conditions of a sentence of probation, conditional discharge or disposition of supervision.\n\n\n(a) Except where specifically prohibited by other provisions of this Code, the court shall impose a sentence of probation or conditional discharge upon an offender unless, having regard to the nature and circumstance of the offense, and to the history, character and condition of the offender, the court is of the opinion that:\n\n\n(1) his imprisonment or periodic imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the public; or\n\n\n(2) probation or conditional discharge would deprecate the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and would be inconsistent with the ends of justice; or\n\n\n(3) a combination of imprisonment with concurrent or consecutive probation when an offender has been admitted into a drug court program under Section 20 of the Drug Court Treatment Act is necessary for the protection of the public and for the rehabilitation of the offender.\n\n\nThe court shall impose as a condition of a sentence of probation, conditional discharge, or supervision, that the probation agency may invoke any sanction from the list of intermediate sanctions adopted by the chief judge of the circuit court for violations of the terms and conditions of the sentence of probation, conditional discharge, or supervision, subject to the provisions of Section 5-6-4 of this Act.\n\n\n(b) The court may impose a sentence of conditional discharge for an offense if the court is of the opinion that neither a sentence of imprisonment nor of periodic imprisonment nor of probation supervision is appropriate.\n\n\n(b-1) Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section do not apply to a defendant charged with a misdemeanor or felony under the Illinois Vehicle Code or reckless homicide under Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 if the defendant within the past 12 months has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor or felony under the Illinois Vehicle Code or reckless homicide under Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012.\n\n\n(c) The court may, upon a plea of guilty or a stipulation by the defendant of the facts supporting the charge or a finding of guilt, defer further proceedings and the imposition of a sentence, and enter an order for supervision of the defendant, if the defendant is not charged with: (i) a Class A misdemeanor, as defined by the following provisions of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012: Sections 11-9.1; 12-3.2; 11-1.50 or 12-15; 26-5 or 48-1; 31-1; 31-6; 31-7; paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (a) of Section 21-1; paragraph (1) through (5), (8), (10), and (11) of subsection (a) of Section 24-1; (ii) a Class A misdemeanor violation of Section 3.01, 3.03-1, or 4.01 of the Humane Care for Animals Act; or (iii) a felony. If the defendant is not barred from receiving an order for supervision as provided in this subsection, the court may enter an order for supervision after considering the circumstances of the offense, and the history, character and condition of the offender, if the court is of the opinion that:\n\n\n(1) the offender is not likely to commit further crimes;\n\n\n(2) the defendant and the public would be best served if the defendant were not to receive a criminal record; and\n\n\n(3) in the best interests of justice an order of supervision is more appropriate than a sentence otherwise permitted under this Code.\n\n\n(c-5) Subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this Section do not apply to a defendant charged with a second or subsequent violation of Section 6-303 of the Illinois Vehicle Code committed while his or her driver’s license, permit or privileges were revoked because of a violation of Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, relating to the offense of reckless homicide, or a similar provision of a law of another state.\n\n\n(d) The provisions of paragraph (c) shall not apply to a defendant charged with violating Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance when the defendant has previously been:\n\n\n(1) convicted for a violation of Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or any similar law or ordinance of another state; or\n\n\n(2) assigned supervision for a violation of Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or any similar law or ordinance of another state; or\n\n\n(3) pleaded guilty to or stipulated to the facts supporting a charge or a finding of guilty to a violation of Section 11-503 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or any similar law or ordinance of another state, and the plea or stipulation was the result of a plea agreement.\n\n\nThe court shall consider the statement of the prosecuting authority with regard to the standards set forth in this Section.\n\n\n(e) The provisions of paragraph (c) shall not apply to a defendant charged with violating Section 16-25 or 16A-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 if said defendant has within the last 5 years been:\n\n\n(1) convicted for a violation of Section 16-25 or 16A-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012; or\n\n\n(2) assigned supervision for a violation of Section 16-25 or 16A-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012.\n\n\nThe court shall consider the statement of the prosecuting authority with regard to the standards set forth in this Section.\n\n\n(f) The provisions of paragraph (c) shall not apply to a defendant charged with: (1) violating Sections 15-111, 15-112, 15-301, paragraph (b) of Section 6-104, Section 11-605, paragraph (d-5) of Section 11-605.1, Section 11-1002.5, or Section 11-1414 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance; or (2) committing a Class A misdemeanor under subsection (c) of Section 11-907 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance.\n\n\n(g) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this Section, the provisions of paragraph (c) shall not apply to a defendant charged with violating Section 3-707, 3-708, 3-710, or 5-401.3 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance if the defendant has within the last 5 years been:\n\n\n(1) convicted for a violation of Section 3-707, 3-708, 3-710, or 5-401.3 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance; or\n\n\n(2) assigned supervision for a violation of Section 3-707, 3-708, 3-710, or 5-401.3 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance.\n\n\nThe court shall consider the statement of the prosecuting authority with regard to the standards set forth in this Section.\n\n\n(h) The provisions of paragraph (c) shall not apply to a defendant under the age of 21 years charged with violating a serious traffic offense as defined in Section 1-187.001 of the Illinois Vehicle Code:\n\n\n(1) unless the defendant, upon payment of the fines, penalties, and costs provided by law, agrees to attend and successfully complete a traffic safety program approved by the court under standards set by the Conference of Chief Circuit Judges. The accused shall be responsible for payment of any traffic safety program fees. If the accused fails to file a certificate of successful completion on or before the termination date of the supervision order, the supervision shall be summarily revoked and conviction entered. The provisions of Supreme Court Rule 402 relating to pleas of guilty do not apply in cases when a defendant enters a guilty plea under this provision; or\n\n\n(2) if the defendant has previously been sentenced under the provisions of paragraph (c) on or after January 1, 1998 for any serious traffic offense as defined in Section 1-187.001 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.\n\n\n(h-1) The provisions of paragraph (c) shall not apply to a defendant under the age of 21 years charged with an offense against traffic regulations governing the movement of vehicles or any violation of Section 6-107 or Section 12-603.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, unless the defendant, upon payment of the fines, penalties, and costs provided by law, agrees to attend and successfully complete a traffic safety program approved by the court under standards set by the Conference of Chief Circuit Judges. The accused shall be responsible for payment of any traffic safety program fees. If the accused fails to file a certificate of successful completion on or before the termination date of the supervision order, the supervision shall be summarily revoked and conviction entered.

Incidents of Probation and of Conditional Discharge.\n\n(a) When an offender is sentenced to probation or conditional discharge, the court shall impose a period as provided in Article 4.5 of Chapter V, and shall specify the conditions under Section 5-6-3.\n\n\n(b) Multiple terms of probation imposed at the same time shall run concurrently.\n\n\n(c) The court may at any time terminate probation or conditional discharge if warranted by the conduct of the offender and the ends of justice, as provided in Section 5-6-4.\n\n\n(c-1) For purposes of this subsection (c-1), a “violent offense” means an offense in which bodily harm is inflicted or force is used against any person or threatened against any person; an offense involving sexual conduct, sexual penetration, or sexual exploitation; an offense involving domestic violence; an offense of domestic battery, violation of an order of protection, stalking, or hate crime; an offense of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol; or an offense involving the possession of a firearm or dangerous weapon. An offender, other than an offender sentenced on a violent offense, shall be entitled to a time credit toward the completion of the offender’s probation or conditional discharge as follows:\n\n\n(1) For obtaining a high school diploma or GED: 90 days.\n\n\n(2) For obtaining an associate’s degree, career certificate, or vocational technical certification: 120 days.\n\n\n(3) For obtaining a bachelor’s degree: 180 days.\n\n\nAn offender’s supervising officer shall promptly and as soon as practicable notify the court of the offender’s right to time credits under this subsection (c-1). Upon receipt of this notification, the court shall enter an order modifying the offender’s remaining period of probation or conditional discharge to reflect the time credit earned. If, before the expiration of the original period or a reduced period of probation or conditional discharge, the court, after a hearing under Section 5-6-4 of this Code, finds that an offender violated one or more conditions of probation or conditional discharge, the court may order that some or all of the time credit to which the offender is entitled under this Section be forfeited.\n\n\n(d) Upon the expiration or termination of the period of probation or of conditional discharge, the court shall enter an order discharging the offender.\n\n\n(e) The court may extend any period of probation or conditional discharge beyond the limits set forth in Article 4.5 of Chapter V upon a violation of a condition of the probation or conditional discharge, for the payment of an assessment required by Section 10.3 of the Cannabis Control Act, Section 411.2 of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, or Section 80 of the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, or for the payment of restitution as provided by an order of restitution under Section 5-5-6 of this Code.\n\n\n(e-5) If payment of restitution as ordered has not been made, the victim shall file a petition notifying the sentencing court, any other person to whom restitution is owed, and the State’s Attorney of the status of the ordered restitution payments unpaid at least 90 days before the probation or conditional discharge expiration date. If payment as ordered has not been made, the court shall hold a review hearing prior to the expiration date, unless the hearing is voluntarily waived by the defendant with the knowledge that waiver may result in an extension of the probation or conditional discharge period or in a revocation of probation or conditional discharge. If the court does not extend probation or conditional discharge, it shall issue a judgment for the unpaid restitution and direct the clerk of the circuit court to file and enter the judgment in the judgment and lien docket, without fee, unless it finds that the victim has recovered a judgment against the defendant for the amount covered by the restitution order.

The Chief Judge of the circuit court of the county may by administrative order establish a program for electronic monitoring of offenders, in which a vendor supplies and monitors the operation of the electronic monitoring device, and collects the fees on behalf of the county. The program shall include provisions for indigent offenders and the collection of unpaid fees. The program shall not unduly burden the offender and shall be subject to review by the Chief Judge.\n\n\nThe Chief Judge of the circuit court may suspend any additional charges or fees for late payment, interest, or damage to any device.\n\n\n(h) Jurisdiction over an offender may be transferred from the sentencing court to the court of another circuit with the concurrence of both courts. Further transfers or retransfers of jurisdiction are also authorized in the same manner. The court to which jurisdiction has been transferred shall have the same powers as the sentencing court. The probation department within the circuit to which jurisdiction has been transferred, or which has agreed to provide supervision, may impose probation fees upon receiving the transferred offender, as provided in subsection (i). For all transfer cases, as defined in Section 9b of the Probation and Probation Officers Act, the probation department from the original sentencing court shall retain all probation fees collected prior to the transfer. After the transfer, all probation fees shall be paid to the probation department within the circuit to which jurisdiction has been transferred.\n\n\n(i) The court shall impose upon an offender sentenced to probation after January 1, 1989 or to conditional discharge after January 1, 1992 or to community service under the supervision of a probation or court services department after January 1, 2004, as a condition of such probation or conditional discharge or supervised community service, a fee of $50 for each month of probation or conditional discharge supervision or supervised community service ordered by the court, unless after determining the inability of the person sentenced to probation or conditional discharge or supervised community service to pay the fee, the court assesses a lesser fee. The court may not impose the fee on a minor who is placed in the guardianship or custody of the Department of Children and Family Services under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 while the minor is in placement. The fee shall be imposed only upon an offender who is actively supervised by the probation and court services department. The fee shall be collected by the clerk of the circuit court. The clerk of the circuit court shall pay all monies collected from this fee to the county treasurer for deposit in the probation and court services fund under Section 15.1 of the Probation and Probation Officers Act.\n\n\nA circuit court may not impose a probation fee under this subsection (i) in excess of $25 per month unless the circuit court has adopted, by administrative order issued by the chief judge, a standard probation fee guide determining an offender’s ability to pay. Of the amount collected as a probation fee, up to $5 of that fee collected per month may be used to provide services to crime victims and their families.\n\n\nThe Court may only waive probation fees based on an offender’s ability to pay. The probation department may re-evaluate an offender’s ability to pay every 6 months, and, with the approval of the Director of Court Services or the Chief Probation Officer, adjust the monthly fee amount. An offender may elect to pay probation fees due in a lump sum. Any offender that has been assigned to the supervision of a probation department, or has been transferred either under subsection (h) of this Section or under any interstate compact, shall be required to pay probation fees to the department supervising the offender, based on the offender’s ability to pay.\n\n\nPublic Act 93-970 deletes the $10 increase in the fee under this subsection that was imposed by Public Act 93-616. This deletion is intended to control over any other Act of the 93rd General Assembly that retains or incorporates that fee increase.\n\n\n(i-5) In addition to the fees imposed under subsection (i) of this Section, in the case of an offender convicted of a felony sex offense (as defined in the Sex Offender Management Board Act) or an offense that the court or probation department has determined to be sexually motivated (as defined in the Sex Offender Management Board Act), the court or the probation department shall assess additional fees to pay for all costs of treatment, assessment, evaluation for risk and treatment, and monitoring the offender, based on that offender’s ability to pay those costs either as they occur or under a payment plan.\n\n\n(j) All fines and costs imposed under this Section for any violation of Chapters 3, 4, 6, and 11 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, and any violation of the Child Passenger Protection Act, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, shall be collected and disbursed by the circuit clerk as provided under the Criminal and Traffic Assessment Act.\n\n\n(k) Any offender who is sentenced to probation or conditional discharge for a felony sex offense as defined in the Sex Offender Management Board Act or any offense that the court or probation department has determined to be sexually motivated as defined in the Sex Offender Management Board Act shall be required to refrain from any contact, directly or indirectly, with any persons specified by the court and shall be available for all evaluations and treatment programs required by the court or the probation department.\n\n\n(l) The court may order an offender who is sentenced to probation or conditional discharge for a violation of an order of protection be placed under electronic surveillance as provided in Section 5-8A-7 of this Code.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21.)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-6-3.1) (from Ch. 38, par. 1005-6-3.1)"

Additionally, the court shall order the defendant to perform no less than 30 hours of community service and not more than 120 hours of community service, if community service is available in the jurisdiction and is funded and approved by the county board where the offense was committed, when the offense (1) was related to or in furtherance of the criminal activities of an organized gang or was motivated by the defendant’s membership in or allegiance to an organized gang; or (2) is a violation of any Section of Article 24 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 where a disposition of supervision is not prohibited by Section 5-6-1 of this Code.

If the court has ordered the defendant to make a report and appear in person under paragraph (1) of this subsection, a copy of the order of protection shall be transmitted to the person or agency so designated by the court;\n\n\n(12) reimburse any “local anti-crime program” as defined in Section 7 of the Anti-Crime Advisory Council Act for any reasonable expenses incurred by the program on the offender’s case, not to exceed the maximum amount of the fine authorized for the offense for which the defendant was sentenced;\n\n\n(13) contribute a reasonable sum of money, not to exceed the maximum amount of the fine authorized for the offense for which the defendant was sentenced, (i) to a “local anti-crime program”, as defined in Section 7 of the Anti-Crime Advisory Council Act, or (ii) for offenses under the jurisdiction of the Department of Natural Resources, to the fund established by the Department of Natural Resources for the purchase of evidence for investigation purposes and to conduct investigations as outlined in Section 805-105 of the Department of Natural Resources (Conservation) Law;\n\n\n(14) refrain from entering into a designated geographic area except upon such terms as the court finds appropriate. Such terms may include consideration of the purpose of the entry, the time of day, other persons accompanying the defendant, and advance approval by a probation officer;\n\n\n(15) refrain from having any contact, directly or indirectly, with certain specified persons or particular types of person, including but not limited to members of street gangs and drug users or dealers;\n\n\n(16) refrain from having in his or her body the presence of any illicit drug prohibited by the Cannabis Control Act, the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, or the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, unless prescribed by a physician, and submit samples of his or her blood or urine or both for tests to determine the presence of any illicit drug;\n\n\n(17) refrain from operating any motor vehicle not equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code; under this condition the court may allow a defendant who is not self-employed to operate a vehicle owned by the defendant’s employer that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device in the course and scope of the defendant’s employment; and\n\n\n(18) if placed on supervision for a sex offense as defined in subsection (a-5) of Section 3-1-2 of this Code, unless the offender is a parent or guardian of the person under 18 years of age present in the home and no non-familial minors are present, not participate in a holiday event involving children under 18 years of age, such as distributing candy or other items to children on Halloween, wearing a Santa Claus costume on or preceding Christmas, being employed as a department store Santa Claus, or wearing an Easter Bunny costume on or preceding Easter.\n\n\n(c-5) If payment of restitution as ordered has not been made, the victim shall file a petition notifying the sentencing court, any other person to whom restitution is owed, and the State’s Attorney of the status of the ordered restitution payments unpaid at least 90 days before the supervision expiration date. If payment as ordered has not been made, the court shall hold a review hearing prior to the expiration date, unless the hearing is voluntarily waived by the defendant with the knowledge that waiver may result in an extension of the supervision period or in a revocation of supervision. If the court does not extend supervision, it shall issue a judgment for the unpaid restitution and direct the clerk of the circuit court to file and enter the judgment in the judgment and lien docket, without fee, unless it finds that the victim has recovered a judgment against the defendant for the amount covered by the restitution order. If the court issues a judgment for the unpaid restitution, the court shall send to the defendant at his or her last known address written notification that a civil judgment has been issued for the unpaid restitution.\n\n\n(d) The court shall defer entering any judgment on the charges until the conclusion of the supervision.\n\n\n(e) At the conclusion of the period of supervision, if the court determines that the defendant has successfully complied with all of the conditions of supervision, the court shall discharge the defendant and enter a judgment dismissing the charges.\n\n\n(f) Discharge and dismissal upon a successful conclusion of a disposition of supervision shall be deemed without adjudication of guilt and shall not be termed a conviction for purposes of disqualification or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime. Two years after the discharge and dismissal under this Section, unless the disposition of supervision was for a violation of Sections 3-707, 3-708, 3-710, 5-401.3, or 11-503 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, or for a violation of Sections 12-3.2, 16-25, or 16A-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, in which case it shall be 5 years after discharge and dismissal, a person may have his record of arrest sealed or expunged as may be provided by law. However, any defendant placed on supervision before January 1, 1980, may move for sealing or expungement of his arrest record, as provided by law, at any time after discharge and dismissal under this Section. A person placed on supervision for a sexual offense committed against a minor as defined in clause (a)(1)(L) of Section 5.2 of the Criminal Identification Act or for a violation of Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance shall not have his or her record of arrest sealed or expunged.\n\n\n(g) A defendant placed on supervision and who during the period of supervision undergoes mandatory drug or alcohol testing, or both, or is assigned to be placed on an approved electronic monitoring device, shall be ordered to pay the costs incidental to such mandatory drug or alcohol testing, or both, and costs incidental to such approved electronic monitoring in accordance with the defendant’s ability to pay those costs. The county board with the concurrence of the Chief Judge of the judicial circuit in which the county is located shall establish reasonable fees for the cost of maintenance, testing, and incidental expenses related to the mandatory drug or alcohol testing, or both, and all costs incidental to approved electronic monitoring, of all defendants placed on supervision. The concurrence of the Chief Judge shall be in the form of an administrative order. The fees shall be collected by the clerk of the circuit court, except as provided in an administrative order of the Chief Judge of the circuit court. The clerk of the circuit court shall pay all moneys collected from these fees to the county treasurer who shall use the moneys collected to defray the costs of drug testing, alcohol testing, and electronic monitoring. The county treasurer shall deposit the fees collected in the county working cash fund under Section 6-27001 or Section 6-29002 of the Counties Code, as the case may be.\n\n\nThe Chief Judge of the circuit court of the county may by administrative order establish a program for electronic monitoring of offenders, in which a vendor supplies and monitors the operation of the electronic monitoring device, and collects the fees on behalf of the county. The program shall include provisions for indigent offenders and the collection of unpaid fees. The program shall not unduly burden the offender and shall be subject to review by the Chief Judge.\n\n\nThe Chief Judge of the circuit court may suspend any additional charges or fees for late payment, interest, or damage to any device.\n\n\n(h) A disposition of supervision is a final order for the purposes of appeal.\n\n\n(i) The court shall impose upon a defendant placed on supervision after January 1, 1992 or to community service under the supervision of a probation or court services department after January 1, 2004, as a condition of supervision or supervised community service, a fee of $50 for each month of supervision or supervised community service ordered by the court, unless after determining the inability of the person placed on supervision or supervised community service to pay the fee, the court assesses a lesser fee. The court may not impose the fee on a minor who is placed in the guardianship or custody of the Department of Children and Family Services under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 while the minor is in placement. The fee shall be imposed only upon a defendant who is actively supervised by the probation and court services department. The fee shall be collected by the clerk of the circuit court. The clerk of the circuit court shall pay all monies collected from this fee to the county treasurer for deposit in the probation and court services fund pursuant to Section 15.1 of the Probation and Probation Officers Act.\n\n\nA circuit court may not impose a probation fee in excess of $25 per month unless the circuit court has adopted, by administrative order issued by the chief judge, a standard probation fee guide determining an offender’s ability to pay. Of the amount collected as a probation fee, not to exceed $5 of that fee collected per month may be used to provide services to crime victims and their families.\n\n\nThe Court may only waive probation fees based on an offender’s ability to pay. The probation department may re-evaluate an offender’s ability to pay every 6 months, and, with the approval of the Director of Court Services or the Chief Probation Officer, adjust the monthly fee amount. An offender may elect to pay probation fees due in a lump sum. Any offender that has been assigned to the supervision of a probation department, or has been transferred either under subsection (h) of this Section or under any interstate compact, shall be required to pay probation fees to the department supervising the offender, based on the offender’s ability to pay.\n\n\n(j) All fines and costs imposed under this Section for any violation of Chapters 3, 4, 6, and 11 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, and any violation of the Child Passenger Protection Act, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, shall be collected and disbursed by the circuit clerk as provided under the Criminal and Traffic Assessment Act.\n\n\n(k) A defendant at least 17 years of age who is placed on supervision for a misdemeanor in a county of 3,000,000 or more inhabitants and who has not been previously convicted of a misdemeanor or felony may as a condition of his or her supervision be required by the court to attend educational courses designed to prepare the defendant for a high school diploma and to work toward a high school diploma or to work toward passing high school equivalency testing or to work toward completing a vocational training program approved by the court. The defendant placed on supervision must attend a public institution of education to obtain the educational or vocational training required by this subsection (k). The defendant placed on supervision shall be required to pay for the cost of the educational courses or high school equivalency testing if a fee is charged for those courses or testing. The court shall revoke the supervision of a person who wilfully fails to comply with this subsection (k). The court shall resentence the defendant upon revocation of supervision as provided in Section 5-6-4. This subsection (k) does not apply to a defendant who has a high school diploma or has successfully passed high school equivalency testing. This subsection (k) does not apply to a defendant who is determined by the court to be a person with a developmental disability or otherwise mentally incapable of completing the educational or vocational program.\n\n\n(l) The court shall require a defendant placed on supervision for possession of a substance prohibited by the Cannabis Control Act, the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, or the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act after a previous conviction or disposition of supervision for possession of a substance prohibited by the Cannabis Control Act, the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, or the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act or a sentence of probation under Section 10 of the Cannabis Control Act or Section 410 of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act and after a finding by the court that the person is addicted, to undergo treatment at a substance abuse program approved by the court.\n\n\n(m) The Secretary of State shall require anyone placed on court supervision for a violation of Section 3-707 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance to give proof of his or her financial responsibility as defined in Section 7-315 of the Illinois Vehicle Code. The proof shall be maintained by the individual in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary of State for a minimum period of 3 years after the date the proof is first filed. The proof shall be limited to a single action per arrest and may not be affected by any post-sentence disposition. The Secretary of State shall suspend the driver’s license of any person determined by the Secretary to be in violation of this subsection. This subsection does not apply to a person who, at the time of the offense, was operating a motor vehicle registered in a state other than Illinois.\n\n\n(n) Any offender placed on supervision for any offense that the court or probation department has determined to be sexually motivated as defined in the Sex Offender Management Board Act shall be required to refrain from any contact, directly or indirectly, with any persons specified by the court and shall be available for all evaluations and treatment programs required by the court or the probation department.\n\n\n(o) An offender placed on supervision for a sex offense as defined in the Sex Offender Management Board Act shall refrain from residing at the same address or in the same condominium unit or apartment unit or in the same condominium complex or apartment complex with another person he or she knows or reasonably should know is a convicted sex offender or has been placed on supervision for a sex offense. The provisions of this subsection (o) do not apply to a person convicted of a sex offense who is placed in a Department of Corrections licensed transitional housing facility for sex offenders.\n\n\n(p) An offender placed on supervision for an offense committed on or after June 1, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-464) that would qualify the accused as a child sex offender as defined in Section 11-9.3 or 11-9.4 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 shall refrain from communicating with or contacting, by means of the Internet, a person who is not related to the accused and whom the accused reasonably believes to be under 18 years of age. For purposes of this subsection (p), “Internet” has the meaning ascribed to it in Section 16-0.1 of the Criminal Code of 2012; and a person is not related to the accused if the person is not: (i) the spouse, brother, or sister of the accused; (ii) a descendant of the accused; (iii) a first or second cousin of the accused; or (iv) a step-child or adopted child of the accused.\n\n\n(q) An offender placed on supervision for an offense committed on or after June 1, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-464) that would qualify the accused as a child sex offender as defined in Section 11-9.3 or 11-9.4 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 shall, if so ordered by the court, refrain from communicating with or contacting, by means of the Internet, a person who is related to the accused and whom the accused reasonably believes to be under 18 years of age. For purposes of this subsection (q), “Internet” has the meaning ascribed to it in Section 16-0.1 of the Criminal Code of 2012; and a person is related to the accused if the person is: (i) the spouse, brother, or sister of the accused; (ii) a descendant of the accused; (iii) a first or second cousin of the accused; or (iv) a step-child or adopted child of the accused.\n\n\n(r) An offender placed on supervision for an offense under Section 11-6, 11-9.1, 11-14.4 that involves soliciting for a juvenile prostitute, 11-15.1, 11-20.1, 11-20.1B, 11-20.3, or 11-21 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, or any attempt to commit any of these offenses, committed on or after June 1, 2009 (the effective date of Public Act 95-983) shall:\n\n\n(i) not access or use a computer or any other device with Internet capability without the prior written approval of the court, except in connection with the offender’s employment or search for employment with the prior approval of the court;\n\n\n(ii) submit to periodic unannounced examinations of the offender’s computer or any other device with Internet capability by the offender’s probation officer, a law enforcement officer, or assigned computer or information technology specialist, including the retrieval and copying of all data from the computer or device and any internal or external peripherals and removal of such information, equipment, or device to conduct a more thorough inspection;\n\n\n(iii) submit to the installation on the offender’s computer or device with Internet capability, at the offender’s expense, of one or more hardware or software systems to monitor the Internet use; and\n\n\n(iv) submit to any other appropriate restrictions concerning the offender’s use of or access to a computer or any other device with Internet capability imposed by the court.\n\n\n(s) An offender placed on supervision for an offense that is a sex offense as defined in Section 2 of the Sex Offender Registration Act that is committed on or after January 1, 2010 (the effective date of Public Act 96-362) that requires the person to register as a sex offender under that Act, may not knowingly use any computer scrub software on any computer that the sex offender uses.\n\n\n(t) An offender placed on supervision for a sex offense as defined in the Sex Offender Registration Act committed on or after January 1, 2010 (the effective date of Public Act 96-262) shall refrain from accessing or using a social networking website as defined in Section 17-0.5 of the Criminal Code of 2012.\n\n\n(u) Jurisdiction over an offender may be transferred from the sentencing court to the court of another circuit with the concurrence of both courts.

Upon imposing such condition on the person, the court shall provide the person with the address of the Program’s offices and the name of the Counselor Supervisor of the Program, and require that the person present himself to the Counselor Supervisor at such address by the close of office hours on the immediately succeeding day during which the Program maintains regular office hours. The clerk of the court shall promptly notify the Counselor Supervisor of each person who has been required to participate in the Program as a condition of his probation and the date on which such condition was imposed. Whether a person is eligible for entry into the Program is a judicial determination.\n\n\n(b) The condition that the person participate in the Probation Challenge Program includes the specific conditions that the person present himself to the Counselor Supervisor of such Program pursuant to paragraph (a), that the person punctually appear for all meetings scheduled between him and any personnel of such Program, and that the person strictly comply with all rules prescribed by the Board of City College of Chicago pursuant to Section 12 of the Probation Challenge Program Act. Violation of any of the specific conditions set forth in this paragraph shall not be grounds for revocation of probation, except where such violation has resulted in the person’s expulsion from the Program.\n\n\n(c) In determining whether to require that a person participate in the Probation Challenge Program as a condition of his probation, the court should consider\n\n\n(1) Whether the person demonstrates a desire to avoid future conduct of the type which resulted in his being sentenced to a term of probation;\n\n\n(2) Whether the type of assistance offered by the Probation Challenge Program is best suited to the person’s needs;\n\n\n(3) Whether the person appears, in light of his age and history, to be a likely candidate for rehabilitation;\n\n\n(4) Whether the person has access to the economic resources, and is exposed to the type of social influences, which would enable him to attain the types of goals established for clients of the Probation Challenge Program without his participating in the Program;\n\n\n(5) Whether the person demonstrates potential for accomplishing the types of goals which would be established for him were he a client of the Probation Challenge Program; and\n\n\n(6) The need for limiting the number of participants in the Probation Challenge Program to a level which can be efficiently managed by the personnel of such Program.\n\n\n(d) Participation by a person in the Probation Challenge Program shall be for the duration of the person’s term of probation. In the event the person successfully attains all the goals which have been established for him by his counselor and instructor in the Probation Challenge Program, the court may, on its own motion, on the motion of the person’s probation officer or at the request of the person, terminate the person’s probation if, in the opinion of the court, such action would best serve the interests of the person and the ends of justice.\n\n\n(e) A person shall be expelled from the Probation Challenge Program upon his violating for the fourth time any of the conditions set forth in paragraph (b). A person who has been expelled from the Probation Challenge Program shall not subsequently participate in such Program absent compelling reasons in favor of such subsequent participation.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 84-1426.)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-6-3.3)"

A defendant shall not be eligible for this Program if the offense he or she has been arrested for and charged with is a violent offense. For purposes of this Program, a “violent offense” is any offense where bodily harm was inflicted or where force was used against any person or threatened against any person, any offense involving sexual conduct, sexual penetration, or sexual exploitation, any offense of domestic violence, domestic battery, violation of an order of protection, stalking, hate crime, and any offense involving the possession of a firearm or dangerous weapon. A defendant shall not be eligible for this Program if he or she has previously been adjudicated a delinquent minor for the commission of a violent offense as defined in this subsection.\n\n\n(b) When a defendant is placed in the Program, after both the defendant and State’s Attorney waive preliminary hearing pursuant to Section 109-3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, the court shall enter an order specifying that the proceedings shall be suspended while the defendant is participating in a Program of not less 12 months.\n\n\n(c) The conditions of the Program shall be that the defendant:\n\n\n(1) not violate any criminal statute of this State or any other jurisdiction;\n\n\n(2) refrain from possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon;\n\n\n(3) make full restitution to the victim or property owner pursuant to Section 5-5-6 of this Code;\n\n\n(4) obtain employment or perform not less than 30 hours of community service, provided community service is available in the county and is funded and approved by the county board; and\n\n\n(5) attend educational courses designed to prepare the defendant for obtaining a high school diploma or to work toward passing high school equivalency testing or to work toward completing a vocational training program.\n\n\n(c-1) The court may give credit toward the fulfillment of community service hours for participation in activities and treatment as determined by court services.\n\n\n(d) The court may, in addition to other conditions, require that the defendant:\n\n\n(1) undergo medical or psychiatric treatment, or treatment or rehabilitation approved by the Illinois Department of Human Services;\n\n\n(2) refrain from having in his or her body the presence of any illicit drug prohibited by the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, the Cannabis Control Act or the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, unless prescribed by a physician, and submit samples of his or her blood or urine or both for tests to determine the presence of any illicit drug;\n\n\n(3) submit to periodic drug testing at a time, manner, and frequency as ordered by the court;\n\n\n(4) pay fines, fees and costs; and\n\n\n(5) in addition, if a minor:\n\n\n(i) reside with his or her parents or in a foster home;\n\n\n(ii) attend school;\n\n\n(iii) attend a non-residential program for youth; or\n\n\n(iv) contribute to his or her own support at home or in a foster home.\n\n\n(e) When the State’s Attorney makes a factually specific offer of proof that the defendant has failed to successfully complete the Program or has violated any of the conditions of the Program, the court shall enter an order that the defendant has not successfully completed the Program and continue the case for arraignment pursuant to Section 113-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 for further proceedings as if the defendant had not participated in the Program.\n\n\n(f) Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions of the Program, the State’s Attorney shall dismiss the case or the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person.\n\n\n(g) A person may only have one discharge and dismissal under this Section within a 4-year period.\n\n\n(h) Notwithstanding subsection (a-1), if the court finds that the defendant suffers from a substance abuse problem, then before the person participates in the Program under this Section, the court may refer the person to the drug court established in that judicial circuit pursuant to Section 15 of the Drug Court Treatment Act.

    "text": "Sec. 5-6-3.6. First Time Weapon Offender Program.\n\n(a) The General Assembly has sought to promote public safety, reduce recidivism, and conserve valuable resources of the criminal justice system through the creation of diversion programs for non-violent offenders. This amendatory Act of the 100th General Assembly establishes a pilot program for first-time, non-violent offenders charged with certain weapons offenses. The General Assembly recognizes some persons, particularly young adults in areas of high crime or poverty, may have experienced trauma that contributes to poor decision making skills, and the creation of a diversionary program poses a greater benefit to the community and the person than incarceration. Under this program, a court, with the consent of the defendant and the State’s Attorney, may sentence a defendant charged with an unlawful use of weapons offense under Section 24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012 or aggravated unlawful use of a weapon offense under Section 24-1.6 of the Criminal Code of 2012, if punishable as a Class 4 felony or lower, to a First Time Weapon Offender Program.\n\n\n(b) A defendant is not eligible for this Program if:\n\n\n(1) the offense was committed during the commission of a violent offense as defined in subsection (h) of this Section;\n\n\n(2) he or she has previously been convicted or placed on probation or conditional discharge for any violent offense under the laws of this State, the laws of any other state, or the laws of the United States;\n\n\n(3) he or she had a prior successful completion of the First Time Weapon Offender Program under this Section;\n\n\n(4) he or she has previously been adjudicated a delinquent minor for the commission of a violent offense;\n\n\n(5) he or she is 21 years of age or older; or\n\n\n(6) he or she has an existing order of protection issued against him or her.\n\n\n(b-5) In considering whether a defendant shall be sentenced to the First Time Weapon Offender Program, the court shall consider the following:\n\n\n(1) the age, immaturity, or limited mental capacity of the defendant;\n\n\n(2) the nature and circumstances of the offense;\n\n\n(3) whether participation in the Program is in the interest of the defendant’s rehabilitation, including any employment or involvement in community, educational, training, or vocational programs;\n\n\n(4) whether the defendant suffers from trauma, as supported by documentation or evaluation by a licensed professional; and\n\n\n(5) the potential risk to public safety.\n\n\n(c) For an offense committed on or after January 1, 2018 (the effective date of Public Act 100-3) and before January 1, 2024, whenever an eligible person pleads guilty to an unlawful use of weapons offense under Section 24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012 or aggravated unlawful use of a weapon offense under Section 24-1.6 of the Criminal Code of 2012, which is punishable as a Class 4 felony or lower, the court, with the consent of the defendant and the State’s Attorney, may, without entering a judgment, sentence the defendant to complete the First Time Weapon Offender Program. When a defendant is placed in the Program, the court shall defer further proceedings in the case until the conclusion of the period or until the filing of a petition alleging violation of a term or condition of the Program. Upon violation of a term or condition of the Program, the court may enter a judgment on its original finding of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided by law. Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions of the Program, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person.\n\n\n(d) The Program shall be at least 18 months and not to exceed 24 months, as determined by the court at the recommendation of the Program administrator and the State’s Attorney. The Program administrator may be appointed by the Chief Judge of each Judicial Circuit.\n\n\n(e) The conditions of the Program shall be that the defendant:\n\n\n(1) not violate any criminal statute of this State or any other jurisdiction;\n\n\n(2) refrain from possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon;\n\n\n(3) obtain or attempt to obtain employment;\n\n\n(4) attend educational courses designed to prepare the defendant for obtaining a high school diploma or to work toward passing high school equivalency testing or to work toward completing a vocational training program;\n\n\n(5) refrain from having in his or her body the presence of any illicit drug prohibited by the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, the Cannabis Control Act, or the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, unless prescribed by a physician, and submit samples of his or her blood or urine or both for tests to determine the presence of any illicit drug;\n\n\n(6) perform a minimum of 50 hours of community service;\n\n\n(7) attend and participate in any Program activities deemed required by the Program administrator, including but not limited to: counseling sessions, in-person and over the phone check-ins, and educational classes; and\n\n\n(8) pay all fines, assessments, fees, and costs.\n\n\n(f) The Program may, in addition to other conditions, require that the defendant:\n\n\n(1) wear an ankle bracelet with GPS tracking;\n\n\n(2) undergo medical or psychiatric treatment, or treatment or rehabilitation approved by the Department of Human Services; and\n\n\n(3) attend or reside in a facility established for the instruction or residence of defendants on probation.\n\n\n(g) There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this Section. If a person is convicted of any offense which occurred within 5 years subsequent to a discharge and dismissal under this Section, the discharge and dismissal under this Section shall be admissible in the sentencing proceeding for that conviction as evidence in aggravation.\n\n\n(h) For purposes of this Section, “violent offense” means any offense in which bodily harm was inflicted or force was used against any person or threatened against any person; any offense involving the possession of a firearm or dangerous weapon; any offense involving sexual conduct, sexual penetration, or sexual exploitation; violation of an order of protection, stalking, hate crime, domestic battery, or any offense of domestic violence.\n\n\n(i) This Section is repealed on January 1, 2024.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 102-245, eff. 8-3-21; 102-1109, eff. 12-21-22.)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-6-3.8)"

The court shall admit the offender to pretrial release pending the hearing unless the alleged violation is itself a criminal offense in which case the offender shall be admitted to pretrial release on such terms as are provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, as amended. In any case where an offender remains incarcerated only as a result of his alleged violation of the court’s earlier order of probation, supervision, conditional discharge, or county impact incarceration such hearing shall be held within 14 days of the onset of said incarceration, unless the alleged violation is the commission of another offense by the offender during the period of probation, supervision or conditional discharge in which case such hearing shall be held within the time limits described in Section 103-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, as amended.\n\n\n(c) The State has the burden of going forward with the evidence and proving the violation by the preponderance of the evidence. The evidence shall be presented in open court with the right of confrontation, cross-examination, and representation by counsel.\n\n\n(d) Probation, conditional discharge, periodic imprisonment and supervision shall not be revoked for failure to comply with conditions of a sentence or supervision, which imposes financial obligations upon the offender unless such failure is due to his willful refusal to pay.\n\n\n(e) If the court finds that the offender has violated a condition at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period, it may continue him on the existing sentence, with or without modifying or enlarging the conditions, or may impose any other sentence that was available under Article 4.5 of Chapter V of this Code or Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code at the time of initial sentencing. If the court finds that the person has failed to successfully complete his or her sentence to a county impact incarceration program, the court may impose any other sentence that was available under Article 4.5 of Chapter V of this Code or Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code at the time of initial sentencing, except for a sentence of probation or conditional discharge. If the court finds that the offender has violated paragraph (8.6) of subsection (a) of Section 5-6-3, the court shall revoke the probation of the offender. If the court finds that the offender has violated subsection (o) of Section 5-6-3.1, the court shall revoke the supervision of the offender.\n\n\n(f) The conditions of probation, of conditional discharge, of supervision, or of a sentence of county impact incarceration may be modified by the court on motion of the supervising agency or on its own motion or at the request of the offender after notice and a hearing.\n\n\n(g) A judgment revoking supervision, probation, conditional discharge, or a sentence of county impact incarceration is a final appealable order.\n\n\n(h) Resentencing after revocation of probation, conditional discharge, supervision, or a sentence of county impact incarceration shall be under Article 4.

The amount of credit to be applied against a sentence of imprisonment or periodic imprisonment when the defendant served a term or partial term of periodic imprisonment shall be calculated upon the basis of the actual days spent in confinement rather than the duration of the term.\n\n\n(i) Instead of filing a violation of probation, conditional discharge, supervision, or a sentence of county impact incarceration, an agent or employee of the supervising agency with the concurrence of his or her supervisor may serve on the defendant a Notice of Intermediate Sanctions. The Notice shall contain the technical violation or violations involved, the date or dates of the violation or violations, and the intermediate sanctions to be imposed. Upon receipt of the Notice, the defendant shall immediately accept or reject the intermediate sanctions. If the sanctions are accepted, they shall be imposed immediately. If the intermediate sanctions are rejected or the defendant does not respond to the Notice, a violation of probation, conditional discharge, supervision, or a sentence of county impact incarceration shall be immediately filed with the court. The State’s Attorney and the sentencing court shall be notified of the Notice of Sanctions. Upon successful completion of the intermediate sanctions, a court may not revoke probation, conditional discharge, supervision, or a sentence of county impact incarceration or impose additional sanctions for the same violation. A notice of intermediate sanctions may not be issued for any violation of probation, conditional discharge, supervision, or a sentence of county impact incarceration which could warrant an additional, separate felony charge. The intermediate sanctions shall include a term of home detention as provided in Article 8A of Chapter V of this Code for multiple or repeat violations of the terms and conditions of a sentence of probation, conditional discharge, or supervision.\n\n\n(j) When an offender is re-sentenced after revocation of probation that was imposed in combination with a sentence of imprisonment for the same offense, the aggregate of the sentences may not exceed the maximum term authorized under Article 4.5 of Chapter V.\n\n\n(k)(1) On and after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly, this subsection (k) shall apply to arrest warrants in Cook County only. An arrest warrant issued under paragraph (3) of subsection (a) when the underlying conviction is for the offense of theft, retail theft, or possession of a controlled substance shall remain active for a period not to exceed 10 years from the date the warrant was issued unless a motion to extend the warrant is filed by the office of the State’s Attorney or by, or on behalf of, the agency supervising the wanted person. A motion to extend the warrant shall be filed within one year before the warrant expiration date and notice shall be provided to the office of the sheriff.\n\n\n(2) If a motion to extend a warrant issued under paragraph (3) of subsection (a) is not filed, the warrant shall be quashed and recalled as a matter of law under paragraph (1) of this subsection (k) and the wanted person’s period of probation, conditional discharge, or supervision shall terminate unsatisfactorily as a matter of law.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 101-406, eff. 1-1-20; 101-652, eff. 1-1-23 .)\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-6-4.1) (from Ch. 38, par. 1005-6-4.1)"

Unless the court orders otherwise, the particular times and conditions of release shall be determined by the Department of Corrections, the sheriff, or the Superintendent of the house of corrections, who is administering the program.\n\n\n(b) A sentence of periodic imprisonment may be imposed to permit the defendant to:\n\n\n(1) seek employment;\n\n\n(2) work;\n\n\n(3) conduct a business or other self-employed occupation including housekeeping;\n\n\n(4) attend to family needs;\n\n\n(5) attend an educational institution, including vocational education;\n\n\n(6) obtain medical or psychological treatment;\n\n\n(7) perform work duties at a county, municipal, or regional correctional or detention institution or facility;\n\n\n(8) continue to reside at home with or without supervision involving the use of an approved electronic monitoring device, subject to Article 8A of Chapter V; or\n\n\n(9) for any other purpose determined by the court.\n\n\n(c) Except where prohibited by other provisions of this Code, the court may impose a sentence of periodic imprisonment for a felony or misdemeanor on a person who is 17 years of age or older. The court shall not impose a sentence of periodic imprisonment if it imposes a sentence of imprisonment upon the defendant in excess of 90 days.\n\n\n(d) A sentence of periodic imprisonment shall be for a definite term of from 3 to 4 years for a Class 1 felony, 18 to 30 months for a Class 2 felony, and up to 18 months, or the longest sentence of imprisonment that could be imposed for the offense, whichever is less, for all other offenses; however, no person shall be sentenced to a term of periodic imprisonment longer than one year if he is committed to a county correctional institution or facility, and in conjunction with that sentence participate in a county work release program comparable to the work and day release program provided for in Article 13 of Chapter III of this Code in State facilities. The term of the sentence shall be calculated upon the basis of the duration of its term rather than upon the basis of the actual days spent in confinement. No sentence of periodic imprisonment shall be subject to the good time credit provisions of Section 3-6-3 of this Code.\n\n\n(e) When the court imposes a sentence of periodic imprisonment, it shall state:\n\n\n(1) the term of such sentence;\n\n\n(2) the days or parts of days which the defendant is to be confined;\n\n\n(3) the conditions.\n\n\n(f) The court may issue an order of protection pursuant to the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986 as a condition of a sentence of periodic imprisonment.

The county board with the concurrence of the Chief Judge of the judicial circuit in which the county is located shall establish reasonable fees for the cost of maintenance, testing, and incidental expenses related to the mandatory drug or alcohol testing, or both, and all costs incidental to approved electronic monitoring, of all offenders with a sentence of periodic imprisonment. The concurrence of the Chief Judge shall be in the form of an administrative order. The fees shall be collected by the clerk of the circuit court, except as provided in an administrative order of the Chief Judge of the circuit court. The clerk of the circuit court shall pay all moneys collected from these fees to the county treasurer who shall use the moneys collected to defray the costs of drug testing, alcohol testing, and electronic monitoring. The county treasurer shall deposit the fees collected in the county working cash fund under Section 6-27001 or Section 6-29002 of the Counties Code, as the case may be.\n\n\n(h) All fees and costs imposed under this Section for any violation of Chapters 3, 4, 6, and 11 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, and any violation of the Child Passenger Protection Act, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, shall be collected and disbursed by the circuit clerk as provided under the Criminal and Traffic Assessment Act.\n\n\nThe Chief Judge of the circuit court of the county may by administrative order establish a program for electronic monitoring of offenders, in which a vendor supplies and monitors the operation of the electronic monitoring device, and collects the fees on behalf of the county. The program shall include provisions for indigent offenders and the collection of unpaid fees. The program shall not unduly burden the offender and shall be subject to review by the Chief Judge.\n\n\nThe Chief Judge of the circuit court may suspend any additional charges or fees for late payment, interest, or damage to any device.\n\n\n(i) A defendant at least 17 years of age who is convicted of a misdemeanor or felony in a county of 3,000,000 or more inhabitants and who has not been previously convicted of a misdemeanor or a felony and who is sentenced to a term of periodic imprisonment may as a condition of his or her sentence be required by the court to attend educational courses designed to prepare the defendant for a high school diploma and to work toward receiving a high school diploma or to work toward passing high school equivalency testing or to work toward completing a vocational training program approved by the court. The defendant sentenced to periodic imprisonment must attend a public institution of education to obtain the educational or vocational training required by this subsection (i). The defendant sentenced to a term of periodic imprisonment shall be required to pay for the cost of the educational courses or high school equivalency testing if a fee is charged for those courses or testing. The court shall revoke the sentence of periodic imprisonment of the defendant who wilfully fails to comply with this subsection (i). The court shall resentence the defendant whose sentence of periodic imprisonment has been revoked as provided in Section 5-7-2. This subsection (i) does not apply to a defendant who has a high school diploma or has successfully passed high school equivalency testing.

Pilot residential and transition treatment program for women.\n\n(a) The General Assembly recognizes:\n\n\n(1) that drug-offending women with children who have been in and out of the criminal justice system for years are a serious problem;\n\n\n(2) that the intergenerational cycle of women continuously being part of the criminal justice system needs to be broken;\n\n\n(3) that the effects of drug offending women with children disrupts family harmony and creates an atmosphere that is not conducive to healthy childhood development;\n\n\n(4) that there is a need for an effective residential community supervision model to provide help to women to become drug free, recover from trauma, focus on healthy mother-child relationships, and establish economic independence and long-term support;\n\n\n(5) that certain non-violent women offenders with children eligible for sentences of incarceration, may benefit from the rehabilitative aspects of gender responsive treatment programs and services. This Section shall not be construed to allow violent offenders to participate in a treatment program.\n\n\n(b) Under the direction of the sheriff and with the approval of the county board of commissioners, the sheriff, in any county with more than 3,000,000 inhabitants, may operate a residential and transition treatment program for women established by the Illinois Department of Corrections if funding has been provided by federal, local or private entities. If the court finds during the sentencing hearing conducted under Section 5-4-1 that a woman convicted of a felony meets the eligibility requirements of the sheriff’s residential and transition treatment program for women, the court may refer the offender to the sheriff’s residential and transition treatment program for women for consideration as a participant as an alternative to incarceration in the penitentiary. The sheriff shall be responsible for supervising all women who are placed in the residential and transition treatment program for women for the 12-month period. In the event that the woman is not accepted for placement in the sheriff’s residential and transition treatment program for women, the court shall proceed to sentence the woman to any other disposition authorized by this Code. If the woman does not successfully complete the residential and transition treatment program for women, the woman’s failure to do so shall constitute a violation of the sentence to the residential and transition treatment program for women.\n\n\n(c) In order to be eligible to be a participant in the pilot residential and transition treatment program for women, the participant shall meet all of the following conditions:\n\n\n(1) The woman has not been convicted of a violent crime as defined in subsection (c) of Section 3 of the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, a Class X felony, first or second degree murder, armed violence, aggravated kidnapping, criminal sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual abuse or a subsequent conviction for criminal sexual abuse, forcible detention, or arson and has not been previously convicted of any of those offenses.\n\n\n(2) The woman must undergo an initial assessment evaluation to determine the treatment and program plan.\n\n\n(3) The woman was recommended and accepted for placement in the pilot residential and transition treatment program for women by the Department of Corrections and has consented in writing to participation in the program under the terms and conditions of the program. The Department of Corrections may consider whether space is available.\n\n\n(d) The program may include a substance abuse treatment program designed for women offenders, mental health, trauma, and medical treatment; parenting skills and family relationship counseling, preparation for a State of Illinois High School Diploma or vocational certificate; life skills program; job readiness and job skill training, and a community transition development plan.\n\n\n(e) With the approval of the Department of Corrections, the sheriff shall issue requirements for the program and inform the participants who shall sign an agreement to adhere to all rules and all requirements for the pilot residential and transition treatment program.\n\n\n(f) Participation in the pilot residential and transition treatment program for women shall be for a period not to exceed 12 months. The period may not be reduced by accumulation of good time.\n\n\n(g) If the woman successfully completes the pilot residential and transition treatment program for women, the sheriff shall notify the Department of Corrections, the court, and the State’s Attorney of the county of the woman’s successful completion.\n\n\n(h) A woman may be removed from the pilot residential and transition treatment program for women for violation of the terms and conditions of the program or in the event she is unable to participate. The failure to complete the program shall be deemed a violation of the conditions of the program. The sheriff shall give notice to the Department of Corrections, the court, and the State’s Attorney of the woman’s failure to complete the program. The Department of Corrections or its designee shall file a petition alleging that the woman has violated the conditions of the program with the court. The State’s Attorney may proceed on the petition under Section 5-4-1 of this Code.\n\n\n(i) The conditions of the pilot residential and transition treatment program for women shall include that the woman while in the program:\n\n\n(1) not violate any criminal statute of any jurisdiction;\n\n\n(2) report or appear in person before any person or agency as directed by the court, the sheriff, or Department of Corrections;\n\n\n(3) refrain from possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon;\n\n\n(4) consent to drug testing;\n\n\n(5) not leave the State without the consent of the court or, in circumstances in which reason for the absence is of such an emergency nature that prior consent by the court is not possible, without prior notification and approval of the Department of Corrections;\n\n\n(6) upon placement in the program, must agree to follow all requirements of the program.\n\n\n(j) The Department of Corrections or the sheriff may terminate the program at any time by mutual agreement or with 30 days prior written notice by either the Department of Corrections or the sheriff.\n\n\n(k) The Department of Corrections may enter into a joint contract with a county with more than 3,000,000 inhabitants to establish and operate a pilot residential and treatment program for women.\n\n\n(l) The Director of the Department of Corrections shall have the authority to develop rules to establish and operate a pilot residential and treatment program for women that shall include criteria for selection of the participants of the program in conjunction and approval by the sentencing court. Violent crime offenders are not eligible to participate in the program.\n\n\n(m) The Department shall report to the Governor and the General Assembly before September 30th of each year on the pilot residential and treatment program for women, including the composition of the program by offenders, sentence, age, offense, and race. Reporting is only required if the pilot residential and treatment program for women is operational.\n\n\n(n) The Department of Corrections or the sheriff may terminate the program with 30 days prior written notice.\n\n\n(o) A county with more than 3,000,000 inhabitants is authorized to apply for funding from federal, local or private entities to create a Residential and Treatment Program for Women.

When an Illinois court (i) imposes multiple sentences of imprisonment on a defendant at the same time or (ii) imposes a sentence of imprisonment on a defendant who is already subject to a sentence of imprisonment imposed by an Illinois court, a court of another state, or a federal court, then the sentences shall run concurrently unless otherwise determined by the Illinois court under this Section.\n\n\n(b) Concurrent terms; misdemeanor and felony. A defendant serving a sentence for a misdemeanor who is convicted of a felony and sentenced to imprisonment shall be transferred to the Department of Corrections, and the misdemeanor sentence shall be merged in and run concurrently with the felony sentence.\n\n\n(c) Consecutive terms; permissive. The court may impose consecutive sentences in any of the following circumstances:\n\n\n(1) If, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and character of the defendant, it is the opinion of the court that consecutive sentences are required to protect the public from further criminal conduct by the defendant, the basis for which the court shall set forth in the record.\n\n\n(2) If one of the offenses for which a defendant was convicted was a violation of Section 32-5.2 (aggravated false personation of a peace officer) of the Criminal Code of 1961 (720 ILCS 5/32-5.2) or a violation of subdivision (b)(5) or (b)(6) of Section 17-2 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 (720 ILCS 5/17-2) and the offense was committed in attempting or committing a forcible felony.\n\n\n(3) If a person charged with a felony commits a separate felony while on pretrial release or in pretrial detention in a county jail facility or county detention facility, then the sentences imposed upon conviction of these felonies may be served consecutively regardless of the order in which the judgments of conviction are entered.\n\n\n(4) If a person commits a battery against a county correctional officer or sheriff’s employee while serving a sentence or in pretrial detention in a county jail facility, then the sentence imposed upon conviction of the battery may be served consecutively with the sentence imposed upon conviction of the earlier misdemeanor or felony, regardless of the order in which the judgments of conviction are entered.\n\n\n(5) If a person admitted to pretrial release following conviction of a felony commits a separate felony while released pretrial or if a person detained in a county jail facility or county detention facility following conviction of a felony commits a separate felony while in detention, then any sentence following conviction of the separate felony may be consecutive to that of the original sentence for which the defendant was released pretrial or detained.\n\n\n(6) If a person is found to be in possession of an item of contraband, as defined in Section 31A-0.1 of the Criminal Code of 2012, while serving a sentence in a county jail or while in pretrial detention in a county jail, the sentence imposed upon conviction for the offense of possessing contraband in a penal institution may be served consecutively to the sentence imposed for the offense for which the person is serving a sentence in the county jail or while in pretrial detention, regardless of the order in which the judgments of conviction are entered.\n\n\n(7) If a person is sentenced for a violation of a condition of pretrial release under Section 32-10 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, any sentence imposed for that violation may be served consecutive to the sentence imposed for the charge for which pretrial release had been granted and with respect to which the defendant has been convicted.\n\n\n(d) Consecutive terms; mandatory.

If an Illinois court has imposed a sentence of imprisonment on a defendant and the defendant is subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a court of another state or a federal court, then the Illinois sentence shall run consecutively to the sentence imposed by the court of the other state or the federal court. That same Illinois court, however, may order that the Illinois sentence run concurrently with the sentence imposed by the court of the other state or the federal court, but only if the defendant applies to that same Illinois court within 30 days after the sentence imposed by the court of the other state or the federal court is finalized.\n\n\n(f) Consecutive terms; aggregate maximums and minimums. The aggregate maximum and aggregate minimum of consecutive sentences shall be determined as follows:\n\n\n(1) For sentences imposed under law in effect prior to February 1, 1978, the aggregate maximum of consecutive sentences shall not exceed the maximum term authorized under Section 5-8-1 (730 ILCS 5/5-8-1) or Article 4.5 of Chapter V for the 2 most serious felonies involved. The aggregate minimum period of consecutive sentences shall not exceed the highest minimum term authorized under Section 5-8-1 (730 ILCS 5/5-8-1) or Article 4.5 of Chapter V for the 2 most serious felonies involved. When sentenced only for misdemeanors, a defendant shall not be consecutively sentenced to more than the maximum for one Class A misdemeanor.\n\n\n(2) For sentences imposed under the law in effect on or after February 1, 1978, the aggregate of consecutive sentences for offenses that were committed as part of a single course of conduct during which there was no substantial change in the nature of the criminal objective shall not exceed the sum of the maximum terms authorized under Article 4.5 of Chapter V for the 2 most serious felonies involved, but no such limitation shall apply for offenses that were not committed as part of a single course of conduct during which there was no substantial change in the nature of the criminal objective. When sentenced only for misdemeanors, a defendant shall not be consecutively sentenced to more than the maximum for one Class A misdemeanor.\n\n\n(g) Consecutive terms; manner served. In determining the manner in which consecutive sentences of imprisonment, one or more of which is for a felony, will be served, the Department of Corrections shall treat the defendant as though he or she had been committed for a single term subject to each of the following:\n\n\n(1) The maximum period of a term of imprisonment shall consist of the aggregate of the maximums of the imposed indeterminate terms, if any, plus the aggregate of the imposed determinate sentences for felonies, plus the aggregate of the imposed determinate sentences for misdemeanors, subject to subsection (f) of this Section.\n\n\n(2) The parole or mandatory supervised release term shall be as provided in paragraph (e) of Section 5-4.5-50 (730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-50) for the most serious of the offenses involved.\n\n\n(3) The minimum period of imprisonment shall be the aggregate of the minimum and determinate periods of imprisonment imposed by the court, subject to subsection (f) of this Section.\n\n\n(4) The defendant shall be awarded credit against the aggregate maximum term and the aggregate minimum term of imprisonment for all time served in an institution since the commission of the offense or offenses and as a consequence thereof at the rate specified in Section 3-6-3 (730 ILCS 5/3-6-3).\n\n\n(h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, all sentences imposed by an Illinois court under this Code shall run concurrent to any and all sentences imposed under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.\n\n\n(Source: P.A. 102-350, eff. 8-13-21; 102-982, eff. 7-1-23; 102-1104, eff. 12-6-22.)\n\n\n\n(730 ILCS 5/5-8-5) (from Ch. 38, par. 1005-8-5)"
